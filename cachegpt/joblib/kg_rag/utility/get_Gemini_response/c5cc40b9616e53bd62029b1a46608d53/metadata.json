Variant rs145568234 associates Disease ulcerative colitis\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **CAPN14:**  This gene encodes a member of the calpain family of cysteine proteases. Calpains are intracellular calcium-dependent enzymes involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and apoptosis.\\n* **LPP:** This gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein called lipophosphoprotein phosphatase, which plays a role in the metabolism of phospholipids, particularly sphingolipids. \\n* **UMPS:** This gene encodes a uridine monophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. It is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. \\n* **RBFOX1:**  This gene encodes a splicing factor that binds to RNA sequences, regulating alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. It is implicated in neurological development and function.\\n* **IL23R:** This gene encodes the receptor for interleukin-23 (IL-23), a cytokine involved in the immune response, particularly in the development and maintenance of Th17 cells, which are known to be associated with inflammation in autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Crohn's disease:**  A chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the gastrointestinal tract, primarily the small intestine and colon. It is characterized by inflammation, ulcers, and fistulas.\\n* **Ulcerative colitis:**  Another chronic IBD that mainly affects the colon, causing inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the colon. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL23R** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Given list is:  CAPN14,  LPP,  UMPS, RBFOX1, IL23R\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
