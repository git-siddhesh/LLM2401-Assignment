Wnt signaling is involved in various developmental processes and cell fate decisions.\\n* **PHGDH:** A gene encoding an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of L-serine, a crucial amino acid for various metabolic pathways.\\n* **TERT:** A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** A type of breast cancer where cancer cells do not express estrogen receptors, making them unresponsive to hormone therapy.\\n* **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis:**  A chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue, leading to breathing difficulties.\\n\\n**Connections:**\\n\\n* **IL23R:** Studies suggest IL23R may be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by influencing immune responses and inflammation in the lungs. \\n* **BTBD9:** BTBD9 has been linked to several cancers, but not specifically to estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer or IPF.\\n* **SFRP4:**  SFRP4 is associated with various cancers, including breast cancer, but not specifically estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer, and has not been directly linked to IPF.\\n* **PHGDH:** PHGDH is known to be involved in metabolic processes and cancer development, but its connection to IPF or estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer is not well-established.\\n* **TERT:** TERT is implicated in various cancers due to its role in telomere maintenance, which can promote cell immortality. It has also been studied in relation to lung fibrosis, but its specific connection to IPF is still being investigated.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL23R** is the gene most strongly associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on current research. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
