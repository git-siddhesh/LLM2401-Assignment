Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **HYKK:**  This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and plays a role in cellular signaling. It's not directly linked to either cervix carcinoma or opiate dependence.\\n* **HOXD3:** This gene is a member of the homeobox family of genes that are involved in embryonic development. While HOXD3 has been implicated in some types of cancer, its role in cervix carcinoma and opiate dependence is unclear.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** This gene is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and plays a crucial role in the immune system.  Variations in HLA-DQA1 have been linked to immune-related diseases, but its connection to cervix carcinoma or opiate dependence is limited.\\n* **ADGRV1:**  This gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in cell signaling. Its role in cancer and addiction is not well established. \\n* **BRCA2:**  This gene is a tumor suppressor gene and mutations in it are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. While BRCA2 has been linked to other types of cancers, its role in cervix carcinoma is not definitive, and its connection to opiate dependence is unknown.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Cervix carcinoma:**  Cancer of the cervix, the lower end of the uterus. \\n* **Opiate dependence:**  A state of addiction to opioid drugs like heroin, morphine, and prescription painkillers.\\n\\n**Key Concepts:**\\n\\n* **Tumor suppressor genes:**  Genes that help regulate cell growth and prevent the development of cancer.\\n* **G protein-coupled receptors:**  A large family of cell surface receptors that are involved in a wide range of cellular processes.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**None of the genes in the list have a direct and established association with both cervix carcinoma and opiate dependence.**  While some genes might be involved in one or the other, a definitive link to both conditions for any of these genes is not currently known. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
