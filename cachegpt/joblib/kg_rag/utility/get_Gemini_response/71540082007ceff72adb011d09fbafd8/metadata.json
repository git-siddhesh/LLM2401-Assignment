Its primary association is with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).\\n\\n**AHR:**\\n* **Full name:**  Aryl hydrocarbon receptor\\n* **Function:**  A transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in detoxification, cell growth, and immune responses.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  Limited evidence suggests AHR may be involved in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, but its role in NAFLD/NASH and cirrhosis is not fully understood.\\n\\n**FAM227B:**\\n* **Full name:** Family with sequence similarity 227 member B\\n* **Function:**  The exact function of FAM227B is unknown. It is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in cell signaling.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  No known direct association with NAFLD/NASH or liver cirrhosis.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene most strongly associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Given list is: PNPLA3,  SULT1B1,  KIT,  AHR, FAM227B\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
