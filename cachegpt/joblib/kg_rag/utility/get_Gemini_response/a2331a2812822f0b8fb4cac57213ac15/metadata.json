It is characterized by the presence of \"pearl-like\" lesions in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision.\\n\\n**Age-related macular degeneration (AMD):** A common eye disease that affects the macula, causing blurred central vision that can lead to difficulty with daily tasks like reading and driving. AMD is one of the leading causes of vision loss in people over the age of 50.\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **CFH (Complement Factor H):** A gene involved in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial part of the immune system.  Mutations in CFH are strongly associated with both AMD and Kuhnt-Junius degeneration.\\n\\n* **CACNA2D1 (Calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta 1):** A gene that codes for a protein involved in calcium signaling in neurons. While mutations in this gene have been linked to certain types of epilepsy, there is no known connection to AMD or Kuhnt-Junius degeneration.\\n\\n* **STAT4 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4):** A gene involved in immune responses and cell signaling. Mutations in STAT4 are associated with increased risk of certain autoimmune diseases but not with AMD or Kuhnt-Junius degeneration.\\n\\n* **LACC1 (Laccase 1):** A gene that codes for an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis. While mutations in LACC1 are associated with albinism, there is no known connection to AMD or Kuhnt-Junius degeneration.\\n\\n* **SFRP4 (Secreted frizzled-related protein 4):** A gene involved in cell signaling and development. Mutations in SFRP4 have been linked to certain types of cancer but not with AMD or Kuhnt-Junius degeneration.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with Kuhnt-Junius degeneration and age-related macular degeneration?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**CFH** is the gene associated with both Kuhnt-Junius degeneration and age-related macular degeneration. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
