MHC molecules are essential for presenting antigens to T cells.\\n* **WNT4:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in various developmental processes, including sex determination and kidney development.\\n* **TNIP1:** A gene that encodes a protein that inhibits the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, a key pathway involved in inflammation and immune response.\\n* **CAPN14:**  A gene that encodes a protein called calpain-14, a protease involved in the degradation of proteins. It has been linked to some cancers, but its role in cervical carcinoma is unclear.\\n* **DTNB:**  Not a known gene. It is possible this is a misnomer or a less common gene name.\\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is associated with both cervix carcinoma and membranous glomerulonephritis. \\n\\n**Explanation:** \\n\\n* **Cervix Carcinoma:** HLA-DQA1 is involved in immune response, and its variations have been linked to increased risk of cervical cancer. \\n* **Membranous Glomerulonephritis:** While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, HLA-DQA1 variations have been associated with increased susceptibility to membranous glomerulonephritis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
