It has been implicated in some cancers, but not specifically squamous cell carcinoma.\\n* **IL6:** A cytokine (signaling molecule) involved in inflammation and immune responses. It is known to play a role in the development and progression of several cancers, including lung cancer. \\n* **ALDH1A2:** An enzyme involved in the metabolism of retinol (vitamin A). Some studies have linked ALDH1A2 to lung cancer development and resistance to chemotherapy.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nWhile **IL6** and **ALDH1A2** are implicated in lung cancer development, **ALDH1A2** is more directly linked to **squamous cell carcinoma**. \\n\\n**Therefore, ALDH1A2 is the gene most associated with squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma from the given list.** \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
