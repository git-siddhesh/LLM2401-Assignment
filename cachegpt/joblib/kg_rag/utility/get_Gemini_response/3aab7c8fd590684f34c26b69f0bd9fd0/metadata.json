It's linked to certain cancers but not directly related to male breast cancer or urticaria.\\n* **ABO (ABO Blood Group):** This gene determines blood type, not directly related to male breast cancer or urticaria.\\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):**  A gene involved in the maintenance of telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. TERT activity is often increased in cancer cells, enabling them to proliferate indefinitely.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Male Breast Cancer:** A rare form of cancer affecting the breast tissue in males.\\n* **Urticaria (Hives):** A skin condition characterized by red, itchy welts.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the listed genes are specifically associated with both male breast cancer and urticaria.  While some of these genes might be involved in various aspects of cancer development or cell function, there is no known direct link between them and these specific conditions. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
