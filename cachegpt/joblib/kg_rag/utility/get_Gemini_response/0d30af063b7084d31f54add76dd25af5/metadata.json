The exact cause is unknown but is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  \\n\\n**Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS):** A group of blood cancers affecting blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. It is characterized by ineffective blood cell production and an increased risk of leukemia.\\n\\n**CCDC33:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in cell-cell interactions. It has been implicated in several cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma.\\n\\n**PCDH15:** A gene encoding a protein involved in cell adhesion and is associated with Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disorder causing hearing and vision loss.\\n\\n**RBFOX1:**  A gene encoding a protein that plays a role in RNA splicing and has been linked to autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\\n\\n**HLA-B:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in the immune system. Specific HLA-B alleles are associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n**ERAP1:** A gene encoding a protein involved in the processing of peptides that are presented to the immune system. It is linked to several autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which gene is associated with Takayasu's arteritis and myelodysplastic syndrome?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-B** is the gene associated with Takayasu's arteritis and myelodysplastic syndrome. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
