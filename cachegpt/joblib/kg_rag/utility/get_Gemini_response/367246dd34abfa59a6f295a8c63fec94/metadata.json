It is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II.\\n\\n**KIT:** A gene that codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling and proliferation. Mutations in KIT are associated with several cancers, including mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\\n\\n**TERT:** A gene that codes for the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.  Mutations in TERT are associated with various cancers.\\n\\n**STAT4:** A gene that codes for a transcription factor involved in the signaling pathways of several cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). STAT4 plays a role in the immune response and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which gene is associated with Sjogren's syndrome and myositis?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**STAT4** \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
