Variations in HLA-DPA1 are associated with various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **PRKAG2:** A gene encoding the gamma-2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Mutations in PRKAG2 can lead to skeletal muscle disorders.\\n* **ERAP1:** A gene encoding endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, an enzyme involved in antigen processing and presentation by the MHC class I pathway. Mutations in ERAP1 are associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer.\\n* **SLC14A2:** A gene coding for a sodium-coupled chloride transporter, which plays a role in regulating salt and water balance in the kidneys. \\n* **FER:** A gene encoding a tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling pathways. It has been linked to cancer and other diseases.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Mature B-cell neoplasm:** A group of cancers that originate from mature B lymphocytes, including various lymphomas and leukemias.\\n* **Androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness):** A common condition characterized by hair loss on the scalp, primarily in men.\\n\\n**Other terms:**\\n\\n* **Androgens:** Hormones like testosterone, primarily involved in male sexual development and other functions.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene associated with mature B-cell neoplasm and androgenic alopecia is **FER**. \\n\\nWhile other genes in the list might be involved in certain immune or cellular processes, there is currently no strong evidence linking them specifically to these two conditions. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with mature B-cell neoplasm and androgenic alopecia.
