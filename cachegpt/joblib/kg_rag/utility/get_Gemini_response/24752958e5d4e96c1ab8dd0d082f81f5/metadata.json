Each rsID represents a unique variation.\\n\\n**Autoimmune disease:** A condition where the body\\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues and organs. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.\\n\\n**Atopic asthma:** A type of asthma that is triggered by allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander.  It is often associated with other allergies like eczema and hay fever. \\n\\n**Association:**  In genetics, \"association\" refers to the statistical relationship between a genetic variant and a trait or disease. A strong association suggests that the variant might play a role in the development of the trait or disease.\\n\\n**Question:**  This question asks for a specific genetic variant (rsID) that is statistically linked to both autoimmune disease and atopic asthma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThis question cannot be answered without additional information. \\nTo determine which variant is associated with autoimmune disease and atopic asthma, you would need:\\n\\n* **Research studies:**  Review scientific literature on the specific rsIDs listed. These studies would need to investigate the association between each variant and the two diseases.\\n* **Statistical significance:**  The strength of the association between the variant and the diseases needs to be considered. A statistically significant association indicates a higher likelihood of a true relationship. \\n\\nProviding only a list of rsIDs is not sufficient to answer the question.\\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with autoimmune disease and atopic asthma.
