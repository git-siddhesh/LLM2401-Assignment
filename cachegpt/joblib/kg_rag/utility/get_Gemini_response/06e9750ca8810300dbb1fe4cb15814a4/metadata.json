Mutations in this gene can lead to various metabolic disorders, but not specifically nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer. \\n* **SYT14:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses. It's not directly associated with nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer.\\n* **VAV3:** This gene encodes a protein involved in cell signaling and cytoskeleton organization. While it plays a role in various biological processes, it's not primarily linked to nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:**  A gene within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) responsible for immune system function. Variations in this gene can influence susceptibility to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders. It's not directly associated with nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer.\\n* **PNPLA3:**  This gene encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically triglyceride hydrolysis. Certain variations in this gene have been linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is no direct link to nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Nephrotic Syndrome:**  A kidney disorder characterized by protein in the urine, low blood albumin, edema, and high cholesterol. It can be caused by various underlying conditions, including genetic factors. \\n* **Oropharynx Cancer:**  A type of cancer that develops in the oropharynx, the part of the throat at the back of the mouth. It can be caused by factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and HPV infection.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the listed genes (PRKAG2, SYT14, VAV3, HLA-DQB1, PNPLA3) are directly associated with nephrotic syndrome or oropharynx cancer. While variations in some genes can influence susceptibility to these diseases, there's no specific gene that directly causes them. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
