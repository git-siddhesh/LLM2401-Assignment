While it's involved in various biological processes, its role in Hodgkin's lymphoma is not well-established.\\n* **ERAP1:** A gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, involved in antigen processing and presentation. It's implicated in immune system regulation and has been linked to various autoimmune diseases, but its direct link to Hodgkin's lymphoma is not well-studied.\\n* **GATA3:** A gene encoding a transcription factor crucial for the development of various cell types, including T cells. Mutations in GATA3 are associated with T-cell lymphoma, but its direct role in Hodgkin's lymphoma is less clear.\\n* **XBP1:** A gene encoding a transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which regulates protein folding and ER stress. While UPR and XBP1 play roles in cancer biology, their specific involvement in Hodgkin's lymphoma is not fully understood.\\n* **FTO:** A gene encoding an enzyme involved in the regulation of fat metabolism. FTO is linked to obesity and metabolic diseases, but its connection to Hodgkin's lymphoma is not established.\\n\\n\\n## Question: \\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosis?\\n\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**None of the listed genes are definitively associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosis.**  While some genes (like GATA3 and XBP1) are linked to cancer biology, the specific association with these lymphoma subtypes needs further research. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
