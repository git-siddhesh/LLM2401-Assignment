Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Variants (rsID)**: These are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variations in a single nucleotide that occur at a specific position in the genome. \\n\\n**Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: A common eye disease that affects the central part of the retina, the macula, leading to vision loss.\\n\\n**Kuhnt-Junius Degeneration:** A rare inherited eye condition causing central vision loss. It's characterized by a central corneal opacity and a distinctive pattern of retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities.\\n\\n**rs7579899:** This SNP is located in the **CFH** gene, which is associated with the complement pathway involved in immune response and inflammation. Variations in **CFH** have been linked to increased risk of AMD.\\n\\n**rs3803662:** This SNP is located in the **ARMS2** gene. This gene plays a role in the formation of the choroid, a vascular layer that supplies nutrients to the retina. Variations in **ARMS2** are also strongly associated with AMD risk.\\n\\n**rs76972608:** This SNP is in the **HTRA1** gene. **HTRA1** is involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix, which plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the retinal tissue. Variations in **HTRA1** have been associated with AMD.\\n\\n**rs10490924:** This SNP is in the **TIMP3** gene. **TIMP3** is a protein that inhibits the breakdown of the extracellular matrix. Variations in **TIMP3** have been linked to AMD.\\n\\n**rs16948876:** This SNP is in the **CFI** gene, which encodes the complement factor I. **CFI** is a protein that regulates the complement cascade, which can be implicated in AMD.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Variant is associated with age related macular degeneration and Kuhnt-Junius degeneration? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe answer cannot be determined from the provided information. While some of the listed SNPs are associated with AMD, none are definitively linked to Kuhnt-Junius degeneration. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
