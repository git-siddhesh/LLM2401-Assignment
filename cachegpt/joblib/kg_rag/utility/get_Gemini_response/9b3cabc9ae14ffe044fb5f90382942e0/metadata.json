Mutations in this gene can cause various conditions, including skeletal abnormalities and some types of cancer. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):** An enzyme that helps maintain the length of telomeres, protective caps at the end of chromosomes. This gene is associated with aging and cancer development.\\n* **HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1:** These are genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. MHC genes play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells. Certain HLA alleles are associated with autoimmune diseases.\\n* **IL6 (Interleukin-6):** A pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in various immune responses. It is associated with autoimmune diseases, inflammation, and cancer.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is associated with both cutaneous lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
