MHC Class II is crucial for the immune system's recognition of antigens and is implicated in various autoimmune disorders.\\n* **CACNA1S and CACNA2D1:**  These genes encode for subunits of the calcium channel Cav1.2, which is important for regulating calcium influx in cells, particularly in the heart and nervous system.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Autoimmune hepatitis:** A chronic inflammatory liver disease characterized by the immune system attacking liver cells.\\n* **Cervix carcinoma:**  A type of cancer that develops in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus.\\n\\n**Association:**\\n\\nWhile all these genes are involved in different biological processes, there is a strong association between **HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1** and autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. These genes influence the presentation of antigens to the immune system and contribute to the development of autoimmunity.  However, there is no direct link between any of these genes and cervix carcinoma. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene associated with autoimmune hepatitis is **HLA-DPA1**. None of the listed genes are associated with cervix carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with autoimmune hepatitis and cervix carcinoma. Given list is:  FAT3,  HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, CACNA1S,  CACNA2D1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
