Each gene resides at a specific locus (location on a chromosome) and has two copies, one inherited from each parent.\\n\\n**Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL):** A type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from B cells in the marginal zone of lymph nodes. It is typically an indolent (slow-growing) cancer.\\n\\n**Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):** The most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It arises from B cells and can spread quickly. \\n\\n**FHOD3:**  A gene that encodes a formin homology domain protein, which regulates the formation of actin filaments in cells.  \\n\\n**PBX2:** A gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in regulating the expression of other genes during development.\\n\\n**RP1:**  A gene that encodes a ribosomal protein, essential for protein synthesis. \\n\\n**KALRN:** A gene that encodes a kalirin protein,  involved in synapse formation and function in the nervous system. \\n\\n**AHR:**  A gene that encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in detoxification and immune response. \\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which gene out of FHOD3, PBX2, RP1, KALRN, AHR is associated with marginal zone lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?**\\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
