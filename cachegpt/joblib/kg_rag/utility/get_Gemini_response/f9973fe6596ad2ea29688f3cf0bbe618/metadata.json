It is often associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n**Membranous Glomerulonephritis (MGN):** A kidney disease characterized by immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane, leading to proteinuria and potentially kidney failure.\\n\\n**PHACTR1:**  Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, class 3, regulatory subunit 1.  This gene encodes a protein involved in autophagy, a process essential for cellular cleanup and survival. \\n\\n**CASZ1:**  CAS zinc finger protein 1. This gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor, playing a role in cellular development and differentiation.\\n\\n**PNPLA3:**  Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3. This gene encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver.\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1:**  Human Leukocyte Antigen, DQA1. This gene is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which plays a crucial role in immune response by presenting antigens to T cells. \\n\\n**ATP2B1:**  ATPase, Ca++ transporting, plasma membrane 1.  This gene encodes a protein that functions as a calcium pump, transporting calcium ions across the plasma membrane, playing a vital role in various cellular processes.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with collagenous colitis and membranous glomerulonephritis? \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is the gene most strongly associated with both collagenous colitis and membranous glomerulonephritis. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
