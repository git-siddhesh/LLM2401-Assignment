Variant rs753660142 associates Disease cervical cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Immunoglobulin Alpha Deficiency (IgA Deficiency):**\\n\\n* **Definition:** A condition where the body does not produce enough IgA, an antibody that protects against infections in the respiratory and digestive systems.\\n* **Genetics:**  While many cases are idiopathic, some cases are linked to genetic factors affecting immune system development. \\n\\n**Cervix Carcinoma:**\\n\\n* **Definition:** A type of cancer that develops in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus.\\n* **Genetics:** Several genes have been linked to increased risk of cervical cancer, including:\\n    * **HPV (Human Papillomavirus):**  The main cause of cervical cancer.\\n    * **TP53:** A tumor suppressor gene commonly mutated in cervical cancer.\\n    * **PTEN:** Another tumor suppressor gene, mutations can increase risk.\\n\\n**Genes in the List:**\\n\\n* **CLPTM1L:**  A gene involved in cell growth and proliferation. Some studies suggest a potential role in cancer development, but its association with cervical cancer is not firmly established.\\n* **STAT3:** A gene involved in cell signaling pathways.  Mutations or dysregulation of STAT3 can contribute to cancer development.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), involved in immune responses. Certain HLA alleles are associated with increased risk of certain diseases, but its specific link to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer is unclear.\\n* **ABO:**  A gene responsible for ABO blood group determination.  No direct connection to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer.\\n* **HLA-DPB1:** Also part of the MHC, involved in immune responses. Like HLA-DQA1, certain alleles may be associated with disease susceptibility, but its link to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer is not well-established.\\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the genes in the list are directly and consistently associated with both immunoglobulin alpha deficiency and cervix carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with immunoglobulin alpha deficiency and cervix carcinoma.
