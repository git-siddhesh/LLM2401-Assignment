Disease latent autoimmune diabetes in adults isa Disease autoimmune disease\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase.  Plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance and cell immortality. Mutations in TERT are implicated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma. \\n* **YLPM1:**  This gene encodes a protein involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle, essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. While implicated in cancer progression, a direct association with lung adenocarcinoma or interstitial lung disease is not well-established.\\n* **FTO:**  Fat mass and obesity-associated gene.  Known to play a role in obesity and metabolic processes. While some studies suggest a possible link to lung cancer, it's not directly associated with interstitial lung disease. \\n* **SHTN1:**  This gene encodes a protein that plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular function.  Not directly associated with lung adenocarcinoma or interstitial lung disease. \\n* **IL23R:** Interleukin 23 Receptor.  This gene encodes a protein involved in the immune system, specifically in the activation of T helper cells.  Mutations in IL23R are associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune conditions, but not directly linked to lung adenocarcinoma or interstitial lung disease.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and interstitial lung disease. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and interstitial lung disease. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and interstitial lung disease.
