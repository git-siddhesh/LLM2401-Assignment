It plays a role in maintaining the urea concentration in the kidneys and other tissues. \\n* **MTTP:**  This gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. It helps in the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).\\n* **PSCA:** This gene encodes a protein that is expressed on the surface of certain cells. It is known to be overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and lung cancer.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is often deregulated in cancer cells, leading to their uncontrolled proliferation.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that arises from glandular cells in the lungs.\\n* **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis:** A chronic lung disease characterized by scarring of the lungs.\\n\\n**Key Concepts:**\\n\\n* **Gene Association with Diseases:**  Certain genes are known to be associated with specific diseases. This association can be direct (e.g., mutations in the gene causing the disease) or indirect (e.g., the gene product being involved in a pathway that contributes to the disease).\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PSCA** is the gene associated with lung adenocarcinoma. However, none of the genes in the list are directly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Given list is:  SLC14A2,  SLC14A2,  MTTP, PSCA, TERT\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
