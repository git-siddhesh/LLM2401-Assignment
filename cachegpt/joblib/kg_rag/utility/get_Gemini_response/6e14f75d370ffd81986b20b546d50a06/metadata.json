They can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or larger variations.\\n\\n**rs numbers:** These are unique identifiers assigned to specific genetic variants within a database such as dbSNP.\\n\\n**Skin Sensitivity to Sun:**  Increased sensitivity to sunlight can lead to sunburns, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer.\\n\\n**Keratinocyte Carcinoma:** This is the most common type of skin cancer, arising from the keratinocytes, which are the cells that make up the outer layer of skin. \\n\\n**Associations:** In genetics, an association refers to a statistical relationship between a genetic variant and a particular trait or disease. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Variant is associated with skin sensitivity to sun and keratinocyte carcinoma? \\n\\n**Answer:**  To answer this question, you would need to consult a database such as PubMed or a genetic database like dbSNP. The rs numbers listed are common SNPs, and some are likely associated with various traits.  However, without further context or research, it's impossible to definitively state which one is associated with skin sensitivity to sun and keratinocyte carcinoma. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
