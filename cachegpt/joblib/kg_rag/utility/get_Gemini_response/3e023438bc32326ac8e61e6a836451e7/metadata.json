A transcription factor involved in immune responses.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** Human leukocyte antigen-DQA1.  Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involved in antigen presentation to immune cells.\\n* **TNFSF13:**  Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 13.  A cytokine involved in inflammation and immune responses.\\n* **CFH:** Complement factor H.  A regulator of the complement system, a part of the innate immune response.\\n* **KITLG:**  KIT ligand.  A growth factor involved in hematopoiesis and immune cell development.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Autoimmune hepatitis:** A chronic liver disease caused by an autoimmune reaction against liver cells.\\n* **Membranous glomerulonephritis:** A kidney disease characterized by immune deposits in the glomerulus, the filtering unit of the kidney. \\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **STAT4** is associated with autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. \\n* **HLA-DQA1** is associated with various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis.\\n* **CFH** is associated with autoimmune diseases, including membranous glomerulonephritis.\\n\\n**Note:** \\n\\n* While  TNFSF13 and KITLG are involved in immune responses, they are not strongly associated with autoimmune hepatitis or membranous glomerulonephritis.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with autoimmune hepatitis and membranous glomerulonephritis. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**STAT4 and HLA-DQA1** are associated with autoimmune hepatitis. **CFH** is associated with membranous glomerulonephritis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
