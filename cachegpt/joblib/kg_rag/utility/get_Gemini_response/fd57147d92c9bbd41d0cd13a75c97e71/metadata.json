It is not directly linked to dengue hemorrhagic fever or wheat allergy.\\n* **EPDR1 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway downregulator 1):** This gene is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. While it has some connections to immune responses, it is not known to be involved in dengue hemorrhagic fever or wheat allergy.\\n* **BABAM1 (brain-abundant membrane-associated protein 1):** This gene encodes a protein found primarily in the brain and has been linked to neurological disorders. It has no known connection to dengue hemorrhagic fever or wheat allergy.\\n* **PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in regulating immune responses. Some studies suggest its association with autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, but its role in wheat allergy is complex and not fully understood. It is not directly linked to dengue hemorrhagic fever.\\n* **WNT4 (wingless-type MMTV integration site 4):** This gene plays a role in developmental processes, including sex determination. It is not associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever or wheat allergy.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the genes in the list are directly associated with both dengue hemorrhagic fever and wheat allergy. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
