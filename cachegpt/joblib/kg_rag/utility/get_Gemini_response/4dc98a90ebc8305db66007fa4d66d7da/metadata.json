Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **PLA2R1:**  Phospholipase A2 receptor 1. A transmembrane protein expressed primarily in podocytes (cells in the kidney). Antibodies against PLA2R1 are a major cause of membranous nephropathy, a kidney disease.\\n* **DTNB:** Di-Thio Nitro Benzene. This is a chemical compound and not a gene.\\n* **FER:** Feline erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog. A tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling and growth. Mutations in FER are associated with various cancers.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** Human leukocyte antigen-DQ alpha 1. A gene involved in the immune system, specifically in antigen presentation to T cells.\\n* **PINX1:** Purine nucleoside phosphorylase/adenosine kinase 1. This gene encodes an enzyme involved in purine metabolism.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Immunoglobulin alpha deficiency:**  A primary immunodeficiency characterized by the absence of IgA antibodies, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. \\n* **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus:**  A form of lupus that primarily affects the skin, causing rashes and other skin lesions.\\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **HLA-DQA1 and Autoimmune Diseases:**  HLA-DQA1 is a major histocompatibility complex gene, and its variants are associated with an increased risk of various autoimmune diseases, including lupus.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is the gene most likely associated with both Immunoglobulin alpha deficiency and Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus, as HLA-DQA1 is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
