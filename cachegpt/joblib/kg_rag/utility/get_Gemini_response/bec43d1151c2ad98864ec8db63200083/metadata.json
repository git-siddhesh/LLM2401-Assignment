Disease ontology identifier of duodenal ulcer is DOID:1724\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**TP53:** Tumor protein p53, a gene involved in cell cycle control and tumor suppression. Not directly associated with malaria or duodenal ulcers.\\n\\n**ABO:**  A gene responsible for the ABO blood group system.  Plays a role in immune response but not directly linked to malaria or duodenal ulcers.\\n\\n**HLA-DPA1:** Part of the HLA complex (Human Leukocyte Antigen), involved in immune system function. Some HLA alleles are associated with increased susceptibility to certain infectious diseases, including malaria, but not specifically duodenal ulcers.\\n\\n**ADGRV1:**  Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor V1, a gene involved in cell-cell interactions and signaling. Not directly associated with malaria or duodenal ulcers. \\n\\n**GNE:**  Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acid, a component of glycoproteins and glycolipids.  Some research suggests potential links to autoimmune diseases, but not specifically malaria or duodenal ulcers.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with malaria and duodenal ulcer?\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**None of the genes in the list are directly associated with both malaria and duodenal ulcers.** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
