Involved in inflammation and immune response.\\n* **PNPLA3:** Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3.  Plays a role in lipid metabolism and is strongly associated with NAFLD and NASH.\\n* **ABCG2:** ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2. Involved in transporting molecules across cell membranes.\\n* **BTC:**  Beta-thromboglobulin.  A platelet protein involved in blood clotting.\\n* **UMPS:**  Uridine monophosphate synthase.  Involved in nucleotide metabolism.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD):**  A chronic liver disease characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver.\\n* **Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):** A more severe form of NAFLD with inflammation and liver cell damage.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene most strongly associated with NAFLD and NASH. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
