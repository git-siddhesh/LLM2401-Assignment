It is characterized by a painful rash that typically affects one side of the body. \\n* **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):**  A type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is characterized by rapid growth of malignant B-cells.\\n* **HLA-B:**  Part of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system, a collection of genes that are involved in the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self. HLA-B specifically encodes for a protein that presents antigens to T cells.\\n* **ATXN2:**  A gene responsible for producing the protein ataxin-2, which plays a role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis. Mutations in ATXN2 are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). \\n* **SLC14A2:** A gene that encodes for a protein involved in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. \\n* **EYA2:**  A gene involved in eye development and function. \\n* **POU5F1B:**  A gene that encodes for a transcription factor, which plays a critical role in the early development of the embryo.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with both herpes zoster and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-B** is associated with both herpes zoster and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
