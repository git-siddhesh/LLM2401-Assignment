Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for each Gene:\\n\\n* **PRKACB:**  This gene encodes the catalytic subunit beta of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is a key regulator of many cellular processes, including metabolism, growth, and differentiation. While PKA has been implicated in thyroid hormone signaling, it is not directly linked to hypothyroidism or thyroid papillary carcinoma.\\n* **FAM13A:**  This gene belongs to the FAM13 family, which has roles in cell signaling and regulation. Its specific function is not fully understood, and it is not known to be associated with hypothyroidism or thyroid papillary carcinoma.\\n* **VAV3:** This gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in cell signaling. It plays a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, but its connection to thyroid disorders is not clear. \\n* **ZFPM2:** This gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in development, particularly in the nervous system and hematopoiesis. Its association with hypothyroidism or thyroid cancer is not established. \\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is often elevated in cancer, including thyroid papillary carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene most directly associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma, as increased telomerase activity is linked to its development.  \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
