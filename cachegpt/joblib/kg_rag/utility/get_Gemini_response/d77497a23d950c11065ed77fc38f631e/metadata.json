MHC proteins are crucial for presenting antigens to immune cells. \\n* **rs6679677:** This variant is located in the gene *PTPN22*, which encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in regulating T cell activation and tolerance. \\n* **rs34691223:** This variant is located in the gene *STAT4*, which encodes a transcription factor involved in immune response and inflammation.\\n* **rs2963222:** This variant is located in the gene *IL2RA*, which encodes the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, a crucial component of T cell signaling.\\n\\n**Disease:**\\n\\n* **Autoimmune disease:** A condition where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, leading to inflammation and damage.\\n* **Anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis (AAV):** A type of autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessels. This is often caused by antibodies directed against neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. \\n\\n## Question: \\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with autoimmune disease and anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis?** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
