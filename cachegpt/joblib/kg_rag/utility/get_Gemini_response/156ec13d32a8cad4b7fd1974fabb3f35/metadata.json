Involved in immune signaling and cellular proliferation.\\n* **PLG:** Plasminogen gene. Involved in fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots) and wound healing. \\n* **PNPLA3:** Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 gene. Involved in lipid metabolism and fat storage.\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase reverse transcriptase gene.  Encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, which maintains telomere length in chromosomes.\\n* **IL23R:** Interleukin 23 receptor gene. Involved in the immune system, particularly in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer characterized by slow growth and the formation of glandular-like structures. \\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** A type of breast cancer that does not have estrogen receptors, making it unresponsive to hormone therapies. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** (Telomerase reverse transcriptase) is associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
