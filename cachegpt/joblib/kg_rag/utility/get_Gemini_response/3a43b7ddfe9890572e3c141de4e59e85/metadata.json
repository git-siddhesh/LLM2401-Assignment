While it is involved in other diseases, it is not directly linked to head and neck cancer or uveal melanoma. \\n* **CACNA2D1:** This gene encodes for a calcium channel subunit involved in various physiological processes. It has been associated with certain types of cancer, but not specifically head and neck or uveal melanoma. \\n* **PSCA:** (Prostate Stem Cell Antigen) This gene is a promising target for cancer therapy due to its overexpression in various cancers. While it is associated with prostate cancer, there is limited evidence to suggest its role in head and neck or uveal melanoma. \\n* **TERT:** (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) This gene plays a vital role in maintaining telomere length, which is crucial for cell division and replication. Overexpression of TERT is commonly observed in various cancers, including head and neck and uveal melanoma. \\n* **SULT1B1:** This gene encodes for a sulfotransferase enzyme involved in the detoxification of various compounds. While it plays a role in metabolism and some diseases, it is not directly linked to head and neck or uveal melanoma. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
