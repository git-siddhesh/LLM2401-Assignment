It has been linked to various cancers, including lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.\\n* **PSCA (Prostate stem cell antigen):** A gene expressed primarily in prostate cancer cells, but also found in other cancers, including gastric cancer.\\n* **CDKAL1 (CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1):** A gene involved in cell cycle regulation. Studies have associated it with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.\\n* **EML4 (Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4):** A gene that fuses with the ALK gene in a specific type of lung cancer called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer. \\n* **ADH1B (Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B):**  A gene encoding an enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism. Variants in this gene can influence alcohol tolerance and susceptibility to alcohol-related diseases.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Gastric Fundus Cancer:**  A type of stomach cancer that arises from the upper portion of the stomach called the fundus. \\n* **Duodenal Ulcer:**  A sore or erosion in the lining of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. \\n\\n**Association:**\\n\\n* **PSCA (Prostate stem cell antigen)** has been found to be overexpressed in gastric fundus cancer, suggesting a potential role in its development. While it's not directly associated with duodenal ulcers, its connection to gastric cancer warrants consideration.\\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with gastric fundus cancer and duodenal ulcer?\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\n**PSCA** is the gene most directly associated with gastric fundus cancer, though not specifically linked to duodenal ulcers. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
