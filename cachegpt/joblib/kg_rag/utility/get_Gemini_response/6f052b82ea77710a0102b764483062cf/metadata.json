They can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or other types of variations. \\n\\n**rs IDs:** These are unique identifiers assigned to specific genetic variations. They are used to easily identify and track specific variations in scientific research.\\n\\n**Large Intestine Cancer:**  Also known as colorectal cancer, is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum.\\n\\n**Prostate Carcinoma:**  A type of cancer that affects the prostate gland, a small gland found in men.\\n\\n**Association:** In genetics, an association refers to a statistical relationship between a genetic variant and a trait or disease. It does not necessarily mean that the variant directly causes the disease, but rather that it is statistically more common in individuals with the disease. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich variant from the list is associated with both large intestine cancer and prostate carcinoma? \\n\\n**Note:** Without access to a database of genetic associations, I cannot provide a definitive answer. To find the answer, you would need to consult databases like:\\n\\n* **GWAS Catalog:**  A comprehensive resource of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that lists associations between genetic variants and various traits and diseases.\\n* **ClinVar:**  A database of human genetic variants and their relationship to human health.\\n\\nYou would need to search these databases for the provided rs IDs and see if they are listed as associated with both large intestine cancer and prostate carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
