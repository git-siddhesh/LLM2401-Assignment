Disease male breast cancer associates Gene CCDC170\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Variants:** These are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - variations in a single nucleotide within a DNA sequence. Each variant has a unique identifier (rs number).\\n\\n**Breast Carcinoma:**  A type of cancer that originates in the breast tissue.\\n\\n**Male Breast Cancer:**  A rare form of breast cancer that occurs in men.\\n\\n**Associations:**  In genetics, an association refers to a statistical link between a genetic variant (like a SNP) and a disease or trait. This doesn't necessarily imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich of the listed SNPs (rs11651755, rs9271588, rs2472493, rs3803662, rs4459895) are associated with breast carcinoma and male breast cancer? \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with breast carcinoma and male breast cancer.
