It's not directly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\\n* **HNF1B:** This gene plays a critical role in the development and function of the pancreas and kidneys. While it can be associated with some genetic disorders, it's not directly linked to IBD or AS.\\n* **TYR:**  This gene is involved in melanin production, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color. It's not directly linked to IBD or AS.\\n* **IL23R:** This gene codes for the interleukin-23 receptor, a key component of the immune system. It has been strongly associated with both inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis.\\n* **TRAF3IP2:** This gene plays a role in the immune system, specifically in the regulation of T cell activation and cytokine production. Studies have shown that it's associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL23R** is the gene associated with both inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
