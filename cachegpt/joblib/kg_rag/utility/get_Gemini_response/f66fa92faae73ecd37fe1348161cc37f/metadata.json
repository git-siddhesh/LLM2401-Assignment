Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n* **Duodenal Ulcer:** A peptic ulcer that occurs in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. It is caused by the breakdown of the protective lining of the duodenum by stomach acid and the enzyme pepsin. \\n* **Atrophic Gastritis:** Chronic inflammation of the stomach lining that leads to a decrease in the number of stomach cells, including those that produce acid and enzymes. This can cause a decrease in stomach acid production and lead to nutrient malabsorption. \\n* **SLC17A4:** This gene codes for the solute carrier family 17 member 4 protein, which is a  vesicular glutamate transporter. It plays a role in the transport of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, in the brain. \\n* **GATA3:** This gene codes for a transcription factor involved in the development and function of various tissues, including the immune system and the gut. \\n* **MST1:** This gene codes for a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. It is involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and the regulation of the cytoskeleton.\\n* **PSCA:** This gene codes for a prostate stem cell antigen, which is a protein found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. \\n* **SCN1A:** This gene codes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1, which is important for the propagation of nerve impulses.\\n\\n## Answer: \\nWhile the question focuses on duodenal ulcer and atrophic gastritis,  **none of the genes listed (SLC17A4, GATA3, MST1, PSCA, SCN1A)** are directly associated with these conditions. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
