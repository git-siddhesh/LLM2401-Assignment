Telomerase activity is often upregulated in cancer cells, contributing to their immortality.\\n* **FER:** A tyrosine kinase gene involved in cell signaling pathways. It is implicated in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. \\n* **PCDH15:**  A gene encoding a protein that functions in the development of the inner ear and is linked to Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes hearing and vision loss.\\n* **PTK2B:**  A gene encoding a protein kinase involved in cell growth, migration, and adhesion. Its mutations are associated with various cancers, including breast cancer.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):** A group of lung diseases characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, often leading to shortness of breath and reduced lung capacity.\\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that does not express the receptors estrogen, progesterone, or HER2. It tends to be more aggressive and less responsive to traditional hormone therapies. \\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list (TERT, FER, TERT, PCDH15, PTK2B) is associated with both interstitial lung disease and triple-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT** has been linked to both interstitial lung disease and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with interstitial lung disease and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is:  TERT,  FER, TERT,  PCDH15, PTK2B'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
