Variant rs380286 associates Disease lung adenocarcinoma\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **SLC17A4:**  Solute carrier family 17 member 4. This gene encodes a protein that is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, playing a role in phosphate transport across cell membranes. \\n* **STAT6:** Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6. This gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in immune responses, particularly in the development of Th2 cells and IgE production. \\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Human leukocyte antigen DQ beta 1. This gene encodes a protein involved in antigen presentation to T cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system. \\n* **TERT:** Telomerase reverse transcriptase. This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds repetitive DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation and contributing to cellular immortality.\\n* **PRX:**  Peroxiredoxin. This gene family encodes a group of antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN):** A group of blood cancers characterized by the overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow.\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that arises from the glandular tissue lining the bronchioles of the lung. \\n\\n**Associations:** \\n\\n* **TERT:** This gene is associated with cancer development, including lung adenocarcinoma, as telomerase activity promotes cell immortality and tumor growth. \\n* **STAT6:** This gene has been linked to lung cancer development and progression, though its specific role in lung adenocarcinoma is still under investigation. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\nOut of the given list, **TERT** is most strongly associated with both myeloproliferative neoplasm and lung adenocarcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm and lung adenocarcinoma. Given list is:  SLC17A4,  STAT6, HLA-DQB1, TERT,  PRX'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
