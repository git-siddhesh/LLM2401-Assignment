Not directly associated with AS or IBD.\\n* **UCK2 (Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2 K):** Involved in protein degradation and cell cycle regulation. No direct connection to AS or IBD.\\n* **YLPM1 (Yippee Like Protein 1):** Function not fully understood, but potentially involved in cell growth and differentiation. No direct connection to AS or IBD. \\n* **DAB2IP (Disabled-2 Interacting Protein):**  Plays a role in cell growth, differentiation, and migration. Not directly associated with AS or IBD. \\n* **IL23R (Interleukin-23 Receptor):** A key component of the immune system, mediating inflammatory responses. **Strongly associated with AS and IBD.**\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease?\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**IL23R** \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
