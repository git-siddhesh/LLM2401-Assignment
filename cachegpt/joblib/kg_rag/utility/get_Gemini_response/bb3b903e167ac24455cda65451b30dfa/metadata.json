Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Each Entity:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **RELN (Reelin):** This gene encodes a large extracellular matrix protein involved in neuronal migration and brain development. While it has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia, it's not directly associated with IPF or TNBC. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):** This gene encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length.  TERT mutations and overexpression are implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, and its role in IPF is being explored.\\n* **PLA2R1 (Phospholipase A2 Receptor 1):** This gene encodes a receptor on the surface of podocytes in the kidney. Autoantibodies against PLA2R1 are a major cause of  **membranous nephropathy**, a kidney disease, not IPF or TNBC. \\n* **DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in DNA methylation, a crucial epigenetic process. DNMT3A mutations are associated with various hematological malignancies (like acute myeloid leukemia),  and its role in IPF and TNBC is currently being studied.\\n* **ABO (ABO Blood Group):** This gene encodes enzymes responsible for producing A, B, or O blood group antigens. While ABO blood group is associated with various disease risks, including certain cancers, it's not directly linked to IPF or TNBC. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** A progressive, irreversible lung disease characterized by scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing. It is currently considered a disease of unknown cause (idiopathic).\\n* **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):** A subtype of breast cancer characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 protein. This type is often more aggressive and less responsive to certain therapies.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nBased on current scientific understanding, **TERT** is the gene most strongly associated with both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and triple-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, further research is needed to fully understand its role in these diseases. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
