Some studies suggest a potential role in cancer development, but its association with cervical cancer is not firmly established.\\n* **STAT3:** A gene involved in cell signaling pathways.  Mutations or dysregulation of STAT3 can contribute to cancer development.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), involved in immune responses. Certain HLA alleles are associated with increased risk of certain diseases, but its specific link to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer is unclear.\\n* **ABO:**  A gene responsible for ABO blood group determination.  No direct connection to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer.\\n* **HLA-DPB1:** Also part of the MHC, involved in immune responses. Like HLA-DQA1, certain alleles may be associated with disease susceptibility, but its link to IgA deficiency or cervical cancer is not well-established.\\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the genes in the list are directly and consistently associated with both immunoglobulin alpha deficiency and cervix carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
