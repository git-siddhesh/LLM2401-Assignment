Mutations in STAT4 have been linked to increased risk of various autoimmune diseases, but not specifically to MPN or breast cancer.\\n\\n**MYH7:** A gene encoding a protein component of the myosin motor protein found in heart muscle. Mutations in MYH7 are associated with heart disease, not MPN or breast cancer.\\n\\n**BTBD9:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and cell growth. While BTBD9 mutations have been associated with various cancers, no clear connection to MPN or estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer is established.\\n\\n**ERAP1:** A gene encoding a protein involved in the processing of peptides presented to the immune system. ERAP1 is not known to be associated with MPN or breast cancer.\\n\\n**TERT:** A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.  TERT mutations are associated with various cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer, but its association with MPN and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer is not well established.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the listed genes (STAT4, MYH7, BTBD9, ERAP1, TERT) are definitively associated with both myeloproliferative neoplasm and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
