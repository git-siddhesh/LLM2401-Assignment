It has been implicated in several cancers, including endometrial cancer, but not specifically sclerosing cholangitis.\\n* **ADGRG6:**  A G protein-coupled receptor with a role in cell adhesion and signaling. \\n* **ATG5:**  A protein involved in autophagy, a cellular process of self-eating.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**STAT3** is the gene most likely associated with endometrial cancer. However, it is not directly linked to sclerosing cholangitis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with endometrial cancer and sclerosing cholangitis.
