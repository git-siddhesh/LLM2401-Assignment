Telomerase is often dysregulated in cancer, including CNS cancers.\\n* **MORC4:**  (MORC Family CW-Type Zinc Finger 4)  is a chromatin remodeler protein, playing a role in regulating gene expression and DNA repair. It is implicated in several cancers.\\n* **DMRT1:** (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor 1)  is a transcription factor involved in sex determination and development. It is not known to be directly associated with CNS cancers or pulmonary fibrosis.\\n* **GRAMD1B:** (GRAM Domain Containing 1B)  is a protein that plays a role in membrane trafficking and vesicle transport. Its exact function is not fully understood, but it has been linked to cancer development.\\n* **GTF2I:** (General Transcription Factor II I)  is a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. It is not known to be directly associated with CNS cancers or pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancer:** A broad term encompassing cancers that arise in the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the CNS. These cancers are diverse in their origin and characteristics.\\n* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):**  A chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue. The cause of IPF is unknown (idiopathic), but it often leads to respiratory failure.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene most strongly associated with both central nervous system cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with central nervous system cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Given list is: TERT,  MORC4,  DMRT1, GRAMD1B,  GTF2I\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
