It presents antigens to T cells, triggering adaptive immunity.\\n* **AKAP6:** Anchoring protein for protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and gene regulation.\\n* **MST1:**  A tumor suppressor gene involved in cell growth regulation, apoptosis, and stress response.\\n* **NTM:** Not a specific gene but likely refers to \"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria\", a group of bacteria causing various infections.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Collagenous Colitis:** An inflammatory bowel disease characterized by a thick layer of collagen beneath the colon\\'s lining. \\n* **Autoimmune Hepatitis:**  A liver disease caused by an autoimmune attack on liver cells.\\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **HLA-DQA1** is strongly linked to **autoimmune diseases** like **autoimmune hepatitis**. \\n* **Collagenous Colitis** is not directly linked to any gene on this list.  It\\'s often associated with environmental factors and other diseases. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is most likely associated with **autoimmune hepatitis**. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
