This makes it less responsive to hormone therapy.\\n\\n**ABO Gene:**  Encodes the ABO blood group system, responsible for various antigens on red blood cells. \\n**SCN1A Gene:**  Encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel 1. It is involved in nerve impulse transmission and linked to epilepsy. \\n**TERT Gene:**  Encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomeres at the end of chromosomes. It plays a role in cell immortality and has been linked to cancer development. \\n**TGM2 Gene:** Encodes transglutaminase 2, an enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and apoptosis.\\n**COL22A1 Gene:** Encodes type XXII collagen, a protein found in connective tissues and may play a role in skeletal development. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT** is associated with both myeloproliferative neoplasm and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is:  ABO, SCN1A, TERT,  TGM2,  COL22A1'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
