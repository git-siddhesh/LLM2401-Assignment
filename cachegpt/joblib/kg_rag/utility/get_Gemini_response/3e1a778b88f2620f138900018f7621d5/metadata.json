Plays a role in immune system function and antigen presentation.  \\n* **ABCG2:** ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2. A transmembrane protein involved in drug transport and detoxification. \\n* **PTK2B:** Protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta. A protein kinase involved in cell signaling pathways, particularly those related to cell growth and proliferation.\\n* **HLA-B:** Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class I, B. Another key component of the immune system, involved in presenting antigens to T cells.\\n* **RP1:** Ribosomal protein 1.  A component of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Psoriatic Arthritis:** An inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, a skin condition. \\n* **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):** A type of aggressive lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. \\n\\n**Association:**\\n\\n* **HLA-DQB1:**  Strongly associated with both Psoriatic Arthritis and DLBCL. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** is associated with both psoriatic arthritis and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
