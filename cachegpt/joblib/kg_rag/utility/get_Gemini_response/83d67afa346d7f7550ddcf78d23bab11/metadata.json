Primarily associated with sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies. **Not associated with liver disease.**\\n* **PNPLA3:** This gene encodes a protein called patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3, involved in triglyceride metabolism.  **This gene is strongly associated with liver cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).**\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene associated with liver cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
