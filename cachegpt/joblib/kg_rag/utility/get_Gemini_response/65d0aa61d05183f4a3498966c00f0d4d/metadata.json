Mutations in NEURL1 have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy. \\n* **SCN1A:**  Encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, critical for neuronal excitability. Mutations in SCN1A are a major cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy.\\n* **HAAO:**  Encodes the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, involved in the kynurenine pathway. This pathway plays a role in neurotransmission and inflammation. While linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, its direct association with epilepsy is less established.\\n* **CLDN14:**  Codes for a protein involved in the formation of tight junctions, crucial for the blood-brain barrier integrity.  While important for brain function, direct association with epilepsy is less clear. \\n* **MYBPC3:**  Codes for a protein involved in cardiac muscle contraction. It's primarily associated with heart conditions, not epilepsy.\\n\\n**Epilepsy:**  A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. \\n* **Focal Epilepsy:**  A type of epilepsy where seizures originate in a specific area of the brain. \\n\\n**Answer:**  **SCN1A** is the gene most strongly associated with epilepsy, particularly focal epilepsy. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
