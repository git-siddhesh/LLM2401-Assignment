It has not been directly linked to anterior uveitis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\n* **TNFSF15 (TNF superfamily, member 15):** This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. It plays a role in immune regulation and inflammation. TNFSF15 has been associated with autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis but not specifically with anterior uveitis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\n* **UGT1A8 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A8):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in detoxification and the metabolism of bilirubin. It is not known to be associated with anterior uveitis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\n* **HBB (Hemoglobin subunit beta):** This gene encodes the beta chain of hemoglobin, a protein responsible for oxygen transport in the blood. While genetic variations in HBB can lead to hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell anemia, it is not directly linked to anterior uveitis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\n* **ERAP1 (Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the processing of peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules to T cells. It plays a crucial role in immune response and has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and other autoimmune diseases. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**ERAP1** is the gene associated with anterior uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
