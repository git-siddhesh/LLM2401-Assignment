HLA-DQB2 is a specific gene within this complex.\\n* **ZFPM2:**  ZFPM2 (Zinc Finger Protein, M2) is a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation and growth.\\n* **KALRN:**  KALRN (Kalirin) is a protein involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.\\n* **PNPLA3:**  PNPLA3 (Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3) is a lipase involved in the metabolism of triglycerides.\\n* **DENND1A:**  DENND1A (DENN domain-containing protein 1A) is a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):**  NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by inflammation and liver cell damage.\\n* **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD):**  NAFLD is a common liver disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
