Studies suggest a potential role in MGN susceptibility.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involved in immune responses. Certain HLA-DQA1 alleles are associated with increased risk of SLE and potentially CLE.\\n* **EPDR1:** A gene encoding a protein involved in calcium signaling and immune cell development.  While not directly linked to MGN or CLE, it plays a role in autoimmune processes.\\n* **CRTC1:**  A transcription co-activator involved in energy metabolism and stress response.  Not directly associated with MGN or CLE.\\n\\n\\n**Answer:** \\n\\nThe gene most strongly associated with both membranous glomerulonephritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus from the given list is **HLA-DQA1**. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
