Each identifier represents a specific location in the genome where a single nucleotide variation can occur. \\n* **Relevance:**  These SNPs might be associated with various traits, including disease susceptibility.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich variant from the list is associated with both autoimmune hepatitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus? \\n\\n**Please note:** I need further information to answer this question. I can provide a list of known SNPs associated with autoimmune hepatitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but I cannot definitively say which variant from the given list is linked to both conditions without specific research data. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
