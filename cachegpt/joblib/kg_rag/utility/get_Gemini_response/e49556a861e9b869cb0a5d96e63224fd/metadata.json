Gene MIR21 associates Disease autoimmune hepatitis. Variant rs6809477 associates Disease autoimmune hepatitis. Variant rs3891175 associates Disease autoimmune hepatitis. Variant rs1794514 associates Disease autoimmune hepatitis. Disease collagenous colitis associates Gene HLA-DQA1. Disease collagenous colitis resembles Disease protein-losing enteropathy. Disease collagenous colitis resembles Disease toxic megacolon. Disease ontology identifier of collagenous colitis is DOID:0060183\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **KALRN:**  Kalirin, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in neuronal development and plasticity.  \\n* **TERT:**  Telomerase reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that helps maintain telomere length, protecting chromosomes from degradation.  \\n* **PLA2R1:** Phospholipase A2 receptor 1, a protein primarily expressed in the glomerulus of the kidneys. Antibodies against this protein are associated with membranous nephropathy.\\n* **NANOS1:** Nanos homolog 1, a protein involved in germ cell development and regulation of gene expression.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQA1, a gene involved in the immune system, specifically antigen presentation. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Autoimmune hepatitis:** A chronic liver disease caused by the immune system attacking the liver cells. \\n* **Collagenous colitis:** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by thickening of the colon's inner lining due to collagen deposits.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with both autoimmune hepatitis and collagenous colitis? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is the gene most likely associated with both autoimmune hepatitis and collagenous colitis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
