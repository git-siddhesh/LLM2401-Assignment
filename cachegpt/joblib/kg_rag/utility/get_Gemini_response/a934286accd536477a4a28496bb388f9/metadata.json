Variant rs200640585 associates Disease breast cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TERT:**  (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)  Encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length. Telomere shortening is associated with aging and cancer.\\n* **HLA-DQB2:** (Human Leukocyte Antigen - DQB2)  Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involved in the immune system's recognition of foreign antigens. \\n* **BRCA2:** (Breast Cancer 2)  A tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers.\\n* **GNE:** (Glucosamine-6-Phosphate Synthase)  Encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate, a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, essential components of cartilage and other tissues.\\n* **STAT3:** (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3)  A transcription factor involved in cell growth, survival, and inflammation.  It plays a role in the development of many cancers, including breast cancer.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors, making it unresponsive to hormonal therapy. \\n* **Myeloproliferative neoplasm:** A group of blood cancers characterized by an overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich of the following genes is associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm? \\n\\n**Answer:** **STAT3** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm. Given list is: TERT,  HLA-DQB2,  BRCA2, GNE,  STAT3\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
