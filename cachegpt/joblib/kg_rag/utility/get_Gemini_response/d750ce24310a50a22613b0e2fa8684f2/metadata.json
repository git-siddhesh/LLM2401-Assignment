Variants can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or larger insertions, deletions, or rearrangements. \\n\\n**Atrophic gastritis:** A chronic inflammatory condition of the stomach characterized by the loss of glandular cells in the stomach lining. It is a risk factor for gastric cancer. \\n\\n**Gastric fundus cancer:** A type of gastric cancer that occurs in the upper part of the stomach, called the fundus.\\n\\n**rs2294008, rs9257809, rs35705950, rs12539707, rs2738048:** These are all rs numbers, which refer to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich SNP from the given list is associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer? \\n\\n**Answer:** The specific SNP associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer from the provided list needs to be researched.  It is not possible to determine the answer without further research. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer.
