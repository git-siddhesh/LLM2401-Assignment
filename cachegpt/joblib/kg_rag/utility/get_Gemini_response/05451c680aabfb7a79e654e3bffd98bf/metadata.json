It plays a role in Crohn's disease, but not psoriasis or myelodysplastic syndrome.\\n* **CHEK2:** (Checkpoint kinase 2) is a protein kinase involved in the cell cycle checkpoint pathway, preventing cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage. Mutations in CHEK2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, not psoriasis or myelodysplastic syndrome.\\n* **HLA-B:** (Human Leukocyte Antigen B) is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene involved in presenting antigens to T cells. Certain HLA-B alleles are strongly associated with psoriasis. \\n* **GCKR:** (Glucokinase Regulatory Protein) is involved in glucose metabolism and is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, not psoriasis or myelodysplastic syndrome. \\n* **PKNOX2:** (Paired-like homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that regulates development and is associated with certain cancers, not psoriasis or myelodysplastic syndrome.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Psoriasis:** A chronic, autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, scaly, itchy patches of skin.\\n* **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS):** A group of cancers affecting blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, leading to low blood counts and increased risk of leukemia.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-B** is associated with psoriasis. While it's not directly linked to myelodysplastic syndrome, some studies suggest a potential association with certain subtypes of MDS. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
