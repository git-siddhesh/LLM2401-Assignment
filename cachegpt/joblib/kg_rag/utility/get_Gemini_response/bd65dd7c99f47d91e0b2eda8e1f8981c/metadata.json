Variant rs4849887 associates Disease estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **JRK:** Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3) gene. Involved in immune signaling and cellular proliferation.\\n* **PLG:** Plasminogen gene. Involved in fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots) and wound healing. \\n* **PNPLA3:** Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 gene. Involved in lipid metabolism and fat storage.\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase reverse transcriptase gene.  Encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, which maintains telomere length in chromosomes.\\n* **IL23R:** Interleukin 23 receptor gene. Involved in the immune system, particularly in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer characterized by slow growth and the formation of glandular-like structures. \\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** A type of breast cancer that does not have estrogen receptors, making it unresponsive to hormone therapies. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** (Telomerase reverse transcriptase) is associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.
