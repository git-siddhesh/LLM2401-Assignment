It's a relatively rare subtype.\\n\\n**Duodenal Ulcer:** A sore that develops in the lining of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.\\n\\n**rs11759064, rs975730, rs1150757, rs2294008, rs7453920:**  These are all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),  variations in a single DNA base pair. They are often associated with disease risk and drug responses.\\n\\n**SNPs and Disease Associations:**  Variations in SNPs can influence an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases. Researchers study the association of specific SNPs with disease prevalence to understand genetic factors contributing to disease development.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich SNP from the list (rs11759064, rs975730, rs1150757, rs2294008, rs7453920) is associated with both gastric fundus cancer and duodenal ulcer? \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
