Variant rs4845604 associates Disease ulcerative colitis\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Variants (SNPs):** Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are variations in a single nucleotide that occur at a specific position in the genome. They are the most common type of genetic variation among humans and can be associated with various traits and diseases. \\n\\n**Kawasaki disease:** An acute, febrile, systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children. It is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, particularly in the coronary arteries.\\n\\n**Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):** A group of inflammatory conditions that affect the digestive tract, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It is characterized by chronic inflammation and ulceration of the intestinal lining.\\n\\n**rs573872:**  Located in the gene *NOD2* (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2). *NOD2* is involved in the immune response and recognition of bacterial pathogens. \\n\\n**rs2072499:** Located in the gene *IL23R* (interleukin-23 receptor). *IL23R* plays a role in the development of inflammatory responses, including those seen in IBD.\\n\\n**rs1333040:** Located in the gene *TNFSF15* (tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 15). *TNFSF15* is involved in the regulation of immune responses and has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions.\\n\\n**rs1801274:** Located in the gene *IL10* (interleukin-10). *IL10* is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that helps to regulate immune responses and prevent excessive inflammation.\\n\\n**rs3757318:** Located in the gene *IL6* (interleukin-6). *IL6* is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in various biological processes, including inflammation and immune response. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which Variant is associated with Kawasaki disease and inflammatory bowel disease?** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
