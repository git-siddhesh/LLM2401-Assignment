Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n* **rs254020**: This variant is located in the gene **CYP1A1** (Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1). CYP1A1 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are found in cigarette smoke and other environmental pollutants. This enzyme also plays a role in the metabolism of some drugs. \\n* **rs4625**: This variant is located in the gene **MC1R** (Melanocortin 1 Receptor). MC1R is a receptor involved in pigmentation and is associated with skin color. This variant has been associated with an increased risk of melanoma in some studies.\\n* **rs6059655**: This variant is located in the gene **TERT** (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase). TERT is an enzyme involved in telomere maintenance, which is essential for cell division and longevity. This variant has been associated with an increased risk of various cancers, including melanoma.\\n* **rs11738191**: This variant is located in the gene **TYR** (Tyrosinase). TYR is an enzyme involved in melanin production. This variant has been associated with various hair and skin pigmentation phenotypes. \\n* **rs2963222**: This variant is located in the gene **TP53** (Tumor Protein P53). TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. This variant has been associated with an increased risk of various cancers, including skin cancer.\\n\\n* **Keratinocyte carcinoma**: This is a type of skin cancer that arises from keratinocytes, which are the main cells of the epidermis (outer layer of skin).\\n* **Skin sensitivity to sun**: This refers to an increased susceptibility to sunburns and other skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.\\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe variant most closely associated with keratinocyte carcinoma and skin sensitivity to the sun is **rs254020** in the **CYP1A1** gene. \\n\\n**Explanation**:  CYP1A1 plays a role in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known to be carcinogenic and can contribute to skin cancer. This variant is also linked to increased skin sensitivity to the sun. \\n\\n**Important Note**: While rs254020 is associated with both keratinocyte carcinoma and skin sensitivity, it's crucial to understand that genetic predisposition is only one factor in the development of these conditions. Other factors like environmental exposure, lifestyle choices, and overall health also play a significant role. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
