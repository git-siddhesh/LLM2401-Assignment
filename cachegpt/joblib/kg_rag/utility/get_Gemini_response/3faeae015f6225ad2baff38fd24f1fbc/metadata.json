Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with increased risk of various cancers, including breast cancer (both estrogen-receptor positive and negative), ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.\\n    * **RBFOX1:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA splicing. It plays a role in cell growth and differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers. \\n    * **UCK2:**  A gene involved in the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia from the body. While it's not directly linked to cancer, alterations in UCK2 function could indirectly contribute to tumor development by affecting cellular metabolism.\\n    * **PNPLA3:**  A gene associated with fat metabolism. Certain variants of PNPLA3 are linked to an increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver cancer, but not specifically breast cancer.\\n    * **RAD51B:**  A gene involved in DNA repair. Like BRCA2, mutations in RAD51B can lead to an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly the triple-negative subtype (estrogen-receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER2 negative).\\n\\n* **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:**  A type of cancer that arises from squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells that form the lining of organs and tissues.  It can occur in various parts of the body, including the skin, lungs, and head and neck.\\n* **Estrogen-Receptor Negative Breast Cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors. These cancers are not fueled by estrogen, and therefore do not respond to hormone therapy.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\nOut of the given list, **BRCA2** and **RAD51B** are associated with squamous cell carcinoma and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with squamous cell carcinoma and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is: BRCA2,  RBFOX1, UCK2,  PNPLA3,  RAD51B\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
