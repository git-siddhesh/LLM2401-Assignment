Variant rs117662433 associates Disease estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Variants:** \\n\\n* **rs1709393:** This is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the gene **ESR1** which encodes the estrogen receptor alpha protein. Estrogen receptor alpha plays a role in both uterine fibroids and breast cancer development. \\n* **rs3118470:** This SNP is located in the gene **PGR** which encodes the progesterone receptor protein. Progesterone receptors are also involved in breast cancer development.\\n* **rs1107345:** This SNP is located in the gene **TP53**. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene and mutations in this gene are frequently observed in various cancers, including breast cancer. \\n* **rs78378222:**  This SNP is located in the gene **FGFR2**. FGFR2 encodes a protein involved in cell growth and differentiation and has been associated with certain types of breast cancer. \\n* **rs1122171:** This SNP is located in the gene **BRCA1**. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene are strongly linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.\\n\\n\\n**Diseases:** \\n\\n* **Uterine Fibroids:**  Benign tumors that grow in the uterus, often associated with estrogen levels and hormonal imbalance.\\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or HER2 protein. \\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **rs1709393 (ESR1):** This SNP has been linked to an increased risk of uterine fibroids and ER-positive breast cancer.  \\n* **rs3118470 (PGR):**  This SNP has been linked to an increased risk of PR-positive breast cancer.\\n* **rs1107345 (TP53):**  This SNP has been linked to an increased risk of various cancers, including breast cancer, but it's not specifically associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer.\\n* **rs78378222 (FGFR2):**  This SNP has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of breast cancer, including some triple-receptor negative subtypes. \\n* **rs1122171 (BRCA1):**  This SNP is not directly associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer.  It is strongly associated with breast cancer overall, but mutations in BRCA1 often lead to ER-positive breast cancers.\\n\\n\\n**Answer:** \\n\\nBased on the provided knowledge, **rs78378222 (FGFR2)** is the variant most likely associated with both uterine fibroids and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. It's crucial to note that this is a simplification, and further research is needed to establish definitive connections between specific SNPs and these diseases. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
