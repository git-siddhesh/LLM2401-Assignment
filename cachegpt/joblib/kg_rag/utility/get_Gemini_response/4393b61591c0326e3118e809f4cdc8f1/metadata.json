This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats to the ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres. \\n* **IL23R:** Interleukin-23 receptor. This gene encodes a receptor protein that is part of the interleukin-23 signaling pathway, which plays a role in immune responses.\\n* **PHACTR1:**  Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, class 3, regulatory subunit 1. This gene encodes a protein that is involved in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades damaged organelles and proteins.\\n* **SLC2A9:** Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter, member 9. This gene encodes a protein that transports glucose across cell membranes.\\n* **JRK:** Jun kinase. This gene encodes a protein kinase involved in cell signaling pathways. \\n\\n**Lung Cancer:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that originates in the cells that line the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs.\\n* **Lung carcinoma:**  A general term for any type of cancer that develops in the lungs, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT** is associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and lung carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
