This gene encodes a protein involved in the transport of glucose across cell membranes.\\n* **MYBPC3:** Myosin Binding Protein C, Cardiac Muscle, 3. This gene encodes a protein that is part of the thick filament in striated muscle and is essential for normal cardiac function.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** Human Leukocyte Antigen, DQ Alpha 1. This gene encodes a protein that is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II, involved in the presentation of antigens to T cells.\\n* **WNT10A:** Wnt Family Member 10A. This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Wnt family, which are secreted signaling molecules involved in various developmental processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Lung Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that originates in the lungs, often associated with smoking and environmental pollutants. \\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer:** A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung carcinoma and triple-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
