While associated with various conditions, there's no strong connection to pulmonary hypertension or dermatomyositis.\\n* **C5:** This gene codes for the complement component 5, a protein involved in the immune system's complement cascade.  While C5 deficiency is associated with infections, it's not directly linked to pulmonary hypertension or dermatomyositis. \\n* **HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1:**  These genes encode for proteins that make up the MHC class II complex. They are crucial for immune response and antigen presentation.  \\n* **AHR:**  The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor that plays a role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental chemicals. While it has been linked to some immune and inflammatory conditions, it is not directly associated with pulmonary hypertension or dermatomyositis.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Pulmonary Hypertension:**  A condition where the blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs is abnormally high, often leading to shortness of breath and fatigue. \\n* **Dermatomyositis:**  An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the skin and muscles.\\n\\n**Key Relationship:**  \\n\\n* **HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1** are associated with both **pulmonary hypertension** and **dermatomyositis**.\\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1 are associated with both pulmonary hypertension and dermatomyositis.** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
