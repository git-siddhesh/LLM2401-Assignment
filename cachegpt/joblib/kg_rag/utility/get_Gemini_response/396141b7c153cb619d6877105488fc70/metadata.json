Mutations in SCN1A are associated with epilepsy, particularly Dravet syndrome. \\n* **ADGRV1:** Encodes the G protein-coupled receptor GPR17, which has been linked to various functions including immune response, cell migration, and nervous system development.\\n* **AHR:**  Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor activated by environmental pollutants.  It's involved in detoxification, inflammation, and immune responses. \\n* **THADA:**  Transducer of regulated adhesion, a protein involved in cell-cell adhesion and signaling, particularly in the immune system and brain development.\\n* **CASZ1:**  A transcription factor that plays a role in neuronal differentiation and development. Mutations are linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Opiate Dependence:** A chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite negative consequences.\\n* **Cervix Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that arises in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. \\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n\\n* The question asks for a gene associated with both opiate dependence and cervix carcinoma. \\n*  It's crucial to note that the provided gene list might not contain the specific gene you are looking for. Researching additional genes is necessary. \\n\\n**Answer:** \\n\\nThe provided gene list does not contain a gene definitively linked to both opiate dependence and cervix carcinoma. Further research is needed to identify the specific gene associated with these conditions. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with opiate dependence and cervix carcinoma. Given list is:  SCN1A, ADGRV1,  AHR, THADA,  CASZ1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
