It plays a role in immune responses and cell migration.\\n    * **UGT1A8:**  A gene that encodes an enzyme involved in detoxification. It metabolizes bilirubin and other substances.\\n    * **CFH:**  A gene that encodes a protein called complement factor H. This protein is part of the complement system, which helps fight infections and remove damaged cells.  Mutations in CFH are a major risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\\n    * **TP53:**  A gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein. It plays a key role in regulating cell growth and preventing cancer.\\n    * **HLA-DQA1:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune system. It is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and is involved in presenting antigens to T cells.\\n\\n* **Diseases:**\\n    * **Age-related macular degeneration (AMD):**  A leading cause of vision loss in people over 50. It damages the macula, the central part of the retina, leading to blurry central vision.\\n    * **Kuhnt-Junius degeneration:**  A rare inherited eye condition that causes a thinning of the cornea and can lead to visual impairment.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**CFH** is the gene associated with both age-related macular degeneration and Kuhnt-Junius degeneration. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
