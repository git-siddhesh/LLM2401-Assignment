Variants can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or larger insertions, deletions, or rearrangements. \\n\\n**Atrophic gastritis:** A chronic inflammatory condition of the stomach characterized by the loss of glandular cells in the stomach lining. It is a risk factor for gastric cancer. \\n\\n**Gastric fundus cancer:** A type of gastric cancer that occurs in the upper part of the stomach, called the fundus.\\n\\n**rs2294008, rs9257809, rs35705950, rs12539707, rs2738048:** These are all rs numbers, which refer to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich SNP from the given list is associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer? \\n\\n**Answer:** The specific SNP associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer from the provided list needs to be researched.
