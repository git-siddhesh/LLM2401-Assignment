Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (both ER-positive and ER-negative), ovarian cancer, and other cancers. \\n* **CLDN14:** A gene encoding a protein involved in cell-cell junctions.  Mutations in CLDN14 have been linked to certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. \\n* **HLA-DPB1:** A gene encoding a protein involved in the immune system.  HLA-DPB1 variations are associated with a range of autoimmune diseases and some cancers, but its direct link to breast cancer is not well-established. \\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Similar to HLA-DPB1,  a gene encoding a protein involved in the immune system.  HLA-DQB1 variations are associated with autoimmune diseases and some cancers, but its direct link to breast cancer is not well-established.\\n* **MTTP:** A gene involved in the production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), a type of fat particle in the blood.  MTTP mutations can lead to hypolipidemia (low cholesterol levels), but its direct association with breast cancer is not clearly established.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer (ER-negative breast cancer):** A type of breast cancer that does not have receptors for estrogen. It tends to be more aggressive than ER-positive breast cancer and doesn't respond to hormonal therapies.\\n* **Squamous cell carcinoma:** A type of cancer that arises from squamous cells, which are flat, thin cells that form the surface of the skin, lining of hollow organs, and some other tissues. It can occur in various locations, including the skin, lungs, and head and neck.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**BRCA2** is the gene most strongly associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma.
