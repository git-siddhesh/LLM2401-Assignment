They can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or other changes.\\n\\n**rsID:** This is a unique identifier assigned to a specific genetic variant. For example, rs10490924 identifies a particular SNP. \\n\\n**Lung Adenocarcinoma:** This is a type of lung cancer that originates in the glandular tissue of the lungs.\\n\\n**Central Nervous System Cancer:** This refers to cancer that affects the brain, spinal cord, or other tissues of the central nervous system.\\n\\n**Association:**  In genetics, association refers to a statistical relationship between a genetic variant and a disease or trait. This doesn't necessarily mean causation but suggests a potential link.\\n\\n## Question: \\n\\nWhich Variant from the list is associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and central nervous system cancer? \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
