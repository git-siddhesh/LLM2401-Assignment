Mutations in this gene are associated with Parkinson's disease.\\n* **HLA-DPA1:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune response. It is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. \\n* **VAV3:** A gene encoding a protein involved in cell signaling and actin cytoskeleton regulation. It plays a role in immune cell function and development. \\n* **RBFOX1:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA splicing. It has been linked to various cancers including glioblastoma and leukemia.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  A gene that, like HLA-DPA1, encodes a protein involved in the immune response as part of the MHC class II. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Cervix carcinoma:** A type of cancer that develops in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. \\n* **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus:** A type of lupus that affects the skin, causing rashes, sores, and other skin abnormalities.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1** are associated with both cervix carcinoma and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
