Variant rs6547741 associates Disease oral cavity cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n* **GCKR (Glucokinase Regulator)**: Primarily involved in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, not directly linked to pancreatic or oral cancers.\\n* **CLPTM1L (CLPTM1-Like)**: This gene is associated with various cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate. Its role in pancreatic and oral cancers is not well-established.\\n* **CHST11 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 11)**: This gene is associated with the synthesis of sulfatides, which play a role in cell signaling and immune function. Its role in pancreatic and oral cancers is not well-established. \\n* **CRTC1 (CREB-Regulated Transcriptional Coactivator 1)**: This gene is involved in regulating gene expression. Studies have linked CRTC1 to the development of pancreatic cancer, including its potential role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.\\n* **COL22A1 (Collagen Type XXII Alpha 1)**: This gene codes for a protein that is part of the extracellular matrix. While its function is not completely understood, studies have suggested its potential association with oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**CRTC1** is the gene associated with pancreatic carcinoma, and **COL22A1** is potentially linked to oral cavity cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with pancreatic carcinoma and oral cavity cancer. Given list is:  GCKR, CLPTM1L,  CHST11, CRTC1,  COL22A1'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
