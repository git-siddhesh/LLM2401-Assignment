It is not directly associated with lung adenocarcinoma or myeloproliferative neoplasm.\\n* **CACNB2 (Calcium Channel Beta 2 Subunit):**  A subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, involved in regulating calcium influx. It has been implicated in some cancers, but not specifically lung adenocarcinoma or myeloproliferative neoplasm.\\n* **PRKAA1 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Alpha 1 Subunit):**  A key regulator of cellular energy metabolism, involved in diverse cellular processes including growth, proliferation, and survival.  It has shown some involvement in cancer, but not specifically lung adenocarcinoma or myeloproliferative neoplasm. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):**  The catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA repeats to the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation. It is **highly associated with cancer** development, including lung adenocarcinoma and other malignancies.\\n* **CACNA1S (Calcium Channel Alpha 1 Subunit S):** A subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels responsible for calcium influx in various cells. It is **associated with certain types of cancers** including myeloproliferative neoplasms.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:**  A type of non-small cell lung cancer characterized by glandular tissue formation.\\n* **Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN):**  A group of blood cancers affecting the bone marrow and blood cells, characterized by overproduction of certain blood cells.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is associated with lung adenocarcinoma. **CACNA1S** is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
