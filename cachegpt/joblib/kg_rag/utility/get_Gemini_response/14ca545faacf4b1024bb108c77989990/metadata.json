Plays a role in growth and development, but not directly associated with duodenal ulcers or malaria. \\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  Human Leukocyte Antigen - DQA1.  Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) involved in immune responses.  Associated with certain autoimmune diseases and susceptibility to infections. \\n* **USHBP1:** Usher syndrome type 1B protein.  A protein involved in hearing and vision, not linked to duodenal ulcers or malaria.\\n* **ABO:**  ABO blood group system.  Determines blood type, associated with some disease susceptibilities but not directly linked to duodenal ulcers or malaria.\\n* **GTF2I:**  General transcription factor II-I.  A transcription factor involved in gene regulation. Not directly associated with duodenal ulcers or malaria.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Duodenal ulcer:**  An open sore in the lining of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).  Often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria or the use of NSAID medications. \\n* **Malaria:** A mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite, *Plasmodium*.  Can cause fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, and other symptoms.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the listed genes are directly associated with both duodenal ulcers and malaria. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
