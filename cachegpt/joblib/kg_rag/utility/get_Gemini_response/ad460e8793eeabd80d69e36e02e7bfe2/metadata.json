Disease liver cirrhosis associates Gene PTRH2\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TFAP2B:**  A transcription factor involved in development, particularly in the head and neck region. Mutations are linked to various cancers, including head and neck cancer.\\n* **TERT:**  Encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length. Overexpression of TERT is associated with various cancers, including liver cancer.\\n* **USHBP1:**  Plays a role in the development of the inner ear and is associated with Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting hearing and vision. Not directly linked to head and neck or liver cancers.\\n* **CACNA2D1:**  Codes for a subunit of the L-type calcium channel, involved in muscle contraction and neuronal activity.  Mutations are linked to various diseases, including some cardiovascular conditions but not primarily related to head and neck or liver cancer.\\n* **CRTC1:**  A coactivator of CREB, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes.  Studies have linked CRTC1 to liver cancer, but not typically to head and neck cancers.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Head and Neck Cancer:**  A group of cancers that develop in the head and neck region, including the mouth, nose, throat, and salivary glands.\\n* **Liver Cirrhosis:**  A chronic liver disease characterized by scarring and loss of liver function.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TFAP2B** is associated with head and neck cancer, while **TERT** is associated with liver cirrhosis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with head and neck cancer and liver cirrhosis. Given list is: TFAP2B,  TERT,  USHBP1, CACNA2D1,  CRTC1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
