Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **STAT4:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in signal transduction, specifically the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for immune system development and function. \\n* **FTO:** A gene that encodes an enzyme involved in fat metabolism. It has been linked to obesity, but no clear association with myositis or Sjogren's syndrome.\\n* **ACOXL:**  A gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the breakdown of fatty acids.  It is not known to be associated with myositis or Sjogren's syndrome. \\n* **MORC4:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA repair and chromosome maintenance. This gene has been linked to some cancers, but no direct link to myositis or Sjogren's syndrome is established.\\n* **TNXB:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of extracellular matrix, a crucial component of tissues. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various connective tissue disorders. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Myositis:**  A group of inflammatory diseases that affect the muscles, causing weakness, pain, and sometimes fatigue.\\n* **Sjogren's syndrome:** An autoimmune disease that primarily affects the moisture-producing glands, leading to dry eyes, dry mouth, and other complications.\\n\\n**Association with Myositis and Sjogren's Syndrome:**\\n\\n* **STAT4:**  Studies have shown a strong association between STAT4 gene variations and increased risk of developing both myositis and Sjogren's syndrome. This gene is implicated in the dysregulation of the immune system, which is a central factor in these autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**STAT4** is the gene associated with both myositis and Sjogren's syndrome. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
