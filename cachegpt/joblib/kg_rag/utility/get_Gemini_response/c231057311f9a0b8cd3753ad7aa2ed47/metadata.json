Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase. This gene encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats to the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres. Telomerase activity is usually low or absent in most somatic cells but is present in germ cells and some stem cells.\\n* **HLA-DQB2:** Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ Beta 2. This gene encodes a subunit of the HLA-DQ molecule, a protein complex that presents antigens to T cells. It plays a role in the immune response.\\n* **EPDR1:** Endothelial Peroxiredoxin 1. This gene encodes a protein that functions as a peroxidase in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays a role in oxidative stress response.\\n* **PNPLA3:** Patatin-Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 3. This gene encodes a protein that acts as a lipase, involved in the breakdown of triglycerides. \\n* **CRTC1:** CREB Regulated Transcription Coactivator 1. This gene encodes a protein that acts as a coactivator of the transcription factor CREB, involved in the regulation of gene expression.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Esophageal adenocarcinoma:** A type of cancer that develops in the lining of the esophagus. \\n* **Barrett's esophagus:** A condition in which the lining of the esophagus is replaced with a type of tissue similar to the lining of the small intestine. This condition is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene most strongly associated with both esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
