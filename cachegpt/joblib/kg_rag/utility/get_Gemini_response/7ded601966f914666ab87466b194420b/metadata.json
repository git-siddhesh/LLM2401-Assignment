Mutations in _GJB2_ can lead to hearing loss.\\n* **_COL1A1_ Gene:** This gene encodes a protein involved in collagen production, which is essential for maintaining the structure of connective tissues, including those in the inner ear. Variations in _COL1A1_ can contribute to hearing loss.\\n\\n**_APOE_ Gene:** While this gene is primarily associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, some studies have linked specific _APOE_ variants to a slightly increased risk of age-related hearing loss.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the given list, **rs1333047** (located in the _GJB2_ gene) is associated with age-related hearing impairment.  **rs61815704** (located in the _MC1R_ gene) is associated with skin sensitivity to sun. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
