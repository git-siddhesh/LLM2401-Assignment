Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Triple-Receptor Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):** \\n\\n* **Characteristics:**  TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \\n* **Aggressiveness:**  TNBC is known for its aggressive nature, often exhibiting rapid growth and a higher risk of metastasis.\\n* **Treatment Challenges:**  The lack of receptor expression makes TNBC less responsive to hormonal therapies and targeted therapies commonly used for other breast cancer subtypes.\\n\\n**Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs):**\\n\\n* **Definition:**  MPNs are a group of blood cancers that involve the overproduction of blood cells, primarily in the bone marrow.\\n* **Types:**  MPNs include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF).\\n* **Symptoms:**  Symptoms can vary depending on the type of MPN and the extent of cell overproduction, but may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, bone pain, and easy bleeding or bruising.\\n\\n**Genes in the list:**\\n\\n* **ERAP1 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1):** Involved in the processing of proteins and peptides, and has been associated with immune system regulation and cancer development. \\n* **SNCA (Alpha-Synuclein):**  Primarily known for its role in Parkinson's disease, but also implicated in other neurological conditions and potentially in some cancers. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):**  An enzyme responsible for maintaining telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes.  TERT is often overexpressed in cancer cells, contributing to their immortality.\\n* **ULK4 (Unc-51 Like Kinase 4):** A protein kinase involved in autophagy, a cellular process of self-digestion. \\n* **ADGRG6 (Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G6):**  A cell surface receptor involved in cell adhesion and signaling, and potentially in some cancers. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)** is associated with both triple-receptor negative breast cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
