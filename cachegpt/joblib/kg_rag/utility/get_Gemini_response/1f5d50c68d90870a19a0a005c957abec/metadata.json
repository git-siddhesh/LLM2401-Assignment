Disease central nervous system cancer associates Gene FAT4\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **FGFR2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2):**  A gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, differentiation, and development. Mutations in FGFR2 can lead to various diseases, including some cancers. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):** A gene that encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes. TERT is often overexpressed in cancer cells, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely.\\n* **HLA-DQA1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQA1):** A gene involved in the immune system. It encodes a protein that plays a role in antigen presentation, which is essential for immune responses. Variations in HLA-DQA1 are associated with susceptibility to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders.\\n* **GTF2I (General Transcription Factor II I):** A gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. It plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription. \\n* **SLC14A2 (Solute Carrier Family 14 Member 2):** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. It is particularly important in the kidney and salivary glands. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):** A group of lung disorders characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue.  This can cause shortness of breath, cough, and other respiratory problems.\\n* **Central Nervous System Cancer:** A type of cancer that originates in the brain or spinal cord. It includes various types of tumors, such as gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases. \\n\\n## Question: \\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with interstitial lung disease and central nervous system cancer?** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
