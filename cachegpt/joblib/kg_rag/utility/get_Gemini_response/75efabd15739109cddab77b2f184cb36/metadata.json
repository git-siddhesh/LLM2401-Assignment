Mutations in this gene have been linked to some types of cancer. \\n* **SYT14:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Its role in cancer and autoimmune diseases is not extensively studied.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which Gene is associated with rheumatic heart disease and oral cavity cancer?** \\n\\n**Answer:**  \\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** has been associated with both rheumatic heart disease and oral cavity cancer. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
