Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TERT:**  This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is often elevated in cancer cells, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely.\\n* **KIT:** This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in KIT can lead to various cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and some types of leukemia.\\n* **DGKK:** This gene encodes diacylglycerol kinase kappa, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is a second messenger that plays a role in cell signaling.\\n* **ATP2B1:** This gene encodes a calcium pump protein that is responsible for transporting calcium ions across cell membranes. ATP2B1 plays a role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and cell signaling.\\n* **IL6:** This gene encodes interleukin 6, a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation, immune response, and cell growth. IL6 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory diseases.\\n\\n**Cancer Types:**\\n\\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer:** This type of breast cancer does not express the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  It is often more aggressive than other types of breast cancer.\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** This type of breast cancer does not express the estrogen receptor (ER). It is often more aggressive than ER-positive breast cancer.\\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\nWhich gene from the given list is associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\n**IL6** is the gene associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
