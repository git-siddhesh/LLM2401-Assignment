Telomere shortening is associated with aging and cell senescence, but telomerase reactivation is a hallmark of cancer.\\n* **MST1:** A serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell growth and apoptosis. Mutations in MST1 have been linked to various cancers, including lung cancer.\\n* **OPTN:**  A protein involved in autophagy and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.  Mutations in OPTN are associated with optic atrophy 1 and have been linked to some cancers.\\n* **TNRC18:** Involved in RNA processing and translation.  Its role in cancer is less well understood.\\n* **PSCA:**  A cell surface antigen that can be targeted by antibodies. It is overexpressed in various cancers, including lung cancer and prostate cancer. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Lung carcinoma:** A type of cancer that originates in the lungs.\\n* **Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN):** A group of blood cancers that arise from the bone marrow, characterized by overproduction of blood cells.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene associated with both lung carcinoma and myeloproliferative neoplasm from the given list is **TERT**. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung carcinoma and myeloproliferative neoplasm. Given list is: TERT, MST1,  OPTN,  TNRC18,  PSCA'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
