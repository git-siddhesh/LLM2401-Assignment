Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**POU5F1B:** Also known as Oct-3/4, this gene plays a crucial role in embryonic stem cell pluripotency and development. It is not known to be directly associated with lung adenocarcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n**SCN1A:** This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, a key component of nerve cell signaling. Mutations in SCN1A are associated with epilepsy, particularly Dravet syndrome, but not specifically linked to lung adenocarcinoma or central nervous system cancer. \\n\\n**STAT4:** This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in signaling pathways related to immune responses. While STAT4 has been implicated in certain types of cancer, it is not known to be directly associated with lung adenocarcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n**TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomere shortening is associated with aging and can contribute to cancer development. While TERT has been found to be upregulated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, it is not specifically linked to central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n**BTNL2:** This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the butyrophilin family.  It has been associated with immune responses and has shown a potential role in certain cancers, but not specifically lung adenocarcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and central nervous system cancer?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the only gene from the list that is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and has been linked to cancer development in general. It's important to note that the association with central nervous system cancer is not as well established as with lung adenocarcinoma. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
