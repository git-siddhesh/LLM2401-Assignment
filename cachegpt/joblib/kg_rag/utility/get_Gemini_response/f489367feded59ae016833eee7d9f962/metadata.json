While associated with various cancers, there's no direct link to oral cavity cancer or autoimmune hepatitis.\\n* **TTLL5:** Encodes a protein involved in microtubule acetylation, playing a role in cell division and intracellular transport. No association with oral cavity cancer or autoimmune hepatitis.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, this gene plays a crucial role in the immune system, presenting antigens to T cells.  It's strongly associated with autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. However, its link to oral cavity cancer is unclear.\\n* **HOXD3:** This gene belongs to the HOX family, a group of transcription factors involved in developmental processes. While some HOX genes have been linked to cancer, HOXD3 itself isn't specifically associated with oral cavity cancer or autoimmune hepatitis.\\n* **SAMM50:** This gene encodes a protein associated with protein trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in cell growth and differentiation. It has been studied in connection with certain cancers, but no specific link to oral cavity cancer or autoimmune hepatitis is established.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Oral Cavity Cancer:** A type of cancer affecting the mouth, including the lips, tongue, and gums. It's often associated with tobacco and alcohol use, but genetic factors also play a role.\\n* **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** A chronic liver inflammation caused by the immune system attacking the liver cells. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic predisposition is a key factor.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which gene from the list is associated with oral cavity cancer and autoimmune hepatitis?**\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
