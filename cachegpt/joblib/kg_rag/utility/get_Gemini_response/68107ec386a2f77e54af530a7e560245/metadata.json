Variant rs11639372 associates Disease lung carcinoma\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TERT:**  Telomerase reverse transcriptase. This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats to the ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres. \\n* **IL23R:** Interleukin-23 receptor. This gene encodes a receptor protein that is part of the interleukin-23 signaling pathway, which plays a role in immune responses.\\n* **PHACTR1:**  Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, class 3, regulatory subunit 1. This gene encodes a protein that is involved in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades damaged organelles and proteins.\\n* **SLC2A9:** Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter, member 9. This gene encodes a protein that transports glucose across cell membranes.\\n* **JRK:** Jun kinase. This gene encodes a protein kinase involved in cell signaling pathways. \\n\\n**Lung Cancer:**\\n\\n* **Lung adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that originates in the cells that line the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs.\\n* **Lung carcinoma:**  A general term for any type of cancer that develops in the lungs, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT** is associated with both lung adenocarcinoma and lung carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and lung carcinoma. Given list is: TERT, IL23R,  PHACTR1,  SLC2A9,  JRK'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
