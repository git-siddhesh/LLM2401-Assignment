It is associated with various neurological and cardiac conditions.\\n* **SLC2A9:** SLC2A9 (solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 9) is a protein involved in glucose transport. It is linked to type 2 diabetes.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** HLA-DQB1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQ Beta 1) is a gene encoding a protein that forms part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. This complex plays a crucial role in the immune system, presenting antigens to T cells.\\n* **CSNK2B:** CSNK2B (casein kinase 2 beta) is a gene encoding a protein that is a subunit of a serine/threonine protein kinase. It is involved in various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** is associated with both nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
