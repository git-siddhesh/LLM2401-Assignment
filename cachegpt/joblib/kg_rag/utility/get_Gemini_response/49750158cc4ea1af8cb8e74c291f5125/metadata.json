Each SNP is designated by a unique rs number (e.g., rs10273639).\\n\\n**Genetic Associations:** Certain SNPs have been linked to various diseases and traits, including androgenic alopecia and squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\n**Question:**  What SNP is associated with both androgenic alopecia and squamous cell carcinoma? \\n\\n**Note:** While SNPs can be associated with diseases, it's crucial to understand that:\\n\\n* **Not all carriers of a specific SNP will develop the disease.**  The association might indicate increased susceptibility or risk, but other factors contribute to disease development.\\n* **Many SNPs are studied in relation to diseases.**  Not all SNPs are definitively linked to a particular disease.  \\n\\n**Further research is necessary to establish the precise role of each SNP and their potential interactions in disease development.** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with androgenic alopecia and squamous cell carcinoma.
