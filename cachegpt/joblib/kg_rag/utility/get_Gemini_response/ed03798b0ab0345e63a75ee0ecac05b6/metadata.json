They are common and can be associated with different traits or diseases.\\n\\n**Prostate Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that arises in the prostate gland, a male reproductive organ.\\n\\n**Large Intestine Cancer:**  A type of cancer that arises in the large intestine, the last part of the digestive system.\\n\\n**rs6983267:** This SNP is located on chromosome 8, in the vicinity of the MYC gene, which is associated with cell growth and proliferation.\\n\\n**rs1150757:** This SNP is located on chromosome 11, in the vicinity of the ATM gene, which is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.\\n\\n**rs3129939:** This SNP is located on chromosome 17, in the vicinity of the TP53 gene, a tumor suppressor gene.\\n\\n**rs12917707:** This SNP is located on chromosome 19, in the vicinity of the BRCA2 gene, involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression.\\n\\n**rs595244:** This SNP is located on chromosome 10, in the vicinity of the PTEN gene, which regulates cell growth and development.\\n\\n**Question:** Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with prostate carcinoma and large intestine cancer?\\n\\n**Answer:** This question cannot be answered without additional information.  The provided list of SNPs are associated with various genes involved in cancer development, but not all of them are specifically linked to both prostate carcinoma and large intestine cancer. Further research is needed to establish definitive associations. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
