Mutations in this gene have been linked to increased risk of various cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and leukemia.\\n* **HLA-B:** Part of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system, a major component of the immune system. HLA-B proteins are involved in presenting antigens to T cells, triggering an immune response.  \\n* **BTN3A1:**  A gene involved in immune response, particularly in activating natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a role in fighting viral infections and tumor cells.\\n* **GSDMB:**  A gene involved in the immune response and inflammation. It encodes a protein that is part of the gasdermin family, which is known to be involved in cell death. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS):** A group of cancers that affect blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.  It leads to the production of abnormal blood cells, increasing the risk of infections, bleeding, and fatigue.\\n* **Allergic Rhinitis:**  An inflammation of the nasal lining triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. Symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion. \\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and allergic rhinitis?** \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
