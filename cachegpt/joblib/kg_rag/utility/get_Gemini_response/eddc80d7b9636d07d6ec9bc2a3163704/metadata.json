Reactivation causes shingles, characterized by a painful rash.\\n* **Immune system involvement:**  Immune suppression can increase the risk of shingles. \\n\\n**Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)**\\n\\n* **Blood cancer:**  A group of cancers affecting blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.\\n* **Abnormal blood cell production:**  MDS leads to the production of abnormal blood cells, resulting in anemia, low platelet count, and increased risk of infection.\\n* **Genetic predisposition:**  Specific genes and genetic mutations can increase the risk of MDS.\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **HLA-B:**  Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), involved in immune system regulation.  \\n* **TMEM71:**  A transmembrane protein with a potential role in cell signaling.\\n* **KITLG:**  A growth factor that promotes the development of certain blood cells.\\n* **PTPRD:**  A protein tyrosine phosphatase, involved in cell signaling and development.\\n* **AHR:**  A receptor protein that plays a role in regulating immune responses.\\n\\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with herpes zoster and myelodysplastic syndrome?** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
