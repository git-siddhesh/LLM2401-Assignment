Mutations in this gene can cause various developmental disorders but are not directly associated with HCM or DCM.\\n* **HLA-B:** A gene involved in the immune system. It plays a role in presenting antigens to immune cells and is associated with several diseases, including some autoimmune disorders, but not HCM or DCM.\\n* **BRCA2:** A tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA repair. Mutations in this gene are linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancer. It is not related to HCM or DCM.\\n* **MST1:**  A gene involved in cell growth regulation and apoptosis. Mutations in this gene have been linked to cancer, but not to HCM or DCM.\\n* **MYH7:** A gene that encodes for myosin heavy chain 7, a protein essential for muscle contraction. Mutations in this gene are a major cause of both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**MYH7** is the gene associated with both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy.
