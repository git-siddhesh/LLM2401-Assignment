No direct link to NMO or neurotic disorders is currently established. \\n* **PCDH7:** This gene is involved in cell adhesion and neuronal development. Mutations in this gene can cause epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. No direct link to NMO or neurotic disorders is currently established.\\n* **CASZ1:** This gene encodes a protein that plays a role in neuronal development. It is associated with certain types of epilepsy and autism. No direct link to NMO or neurotic disorders is currently established.\\n* **GATA3:** This gene is involved in the development and function of immune cells and the nervous system. Mutations in this gene can cause a range of disorders, including immune deficiencies, developmental delays, and certain types of cancer. There is limited research suggesting a possible association with NMO. No direct link to neurotic disorders is currently established.\\n* **TNXB:** This gene codes for a protein involved in connective tissue and the development of the nervous system. It is associated with certain rare inherited diseases affecting connective tissues. No direct link to NMO or neurotic disorders is currently established. \\n\\n**Question:** Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with neuromyelitis optica and neurotic disorder. \\n\\n**Answer:** Based on the current knowledge, **none of the listed genes (TNRC18, PCDH7, CASZ1, GATA3, TNXB) are definitively associated with neuromyelitis optica and neurotic disorders.** While some genes may have indirect links through their involvement in immune and nervous system functions, more research is needed to establish a conclusive association. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
