For example:**\\n\\n* **GWAS Catalog:** A database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that identify SNPs associated with different traits and diseases.\\n* **ClinVar:** A database of clinically relevant variations in the human genome.\\n\\n**Without access to such databases, I cannot definitively answer which variant is associated with aortic stenosis and large artery stroke.** \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
