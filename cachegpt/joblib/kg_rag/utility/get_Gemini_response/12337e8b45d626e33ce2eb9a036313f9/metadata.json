SNPs are common in the human genome and are often used as markers for genetic studies. \\n\\n**rsID:** A unique identifier assigned to each SNP.\\n\\n**Variants**: Alternate forms of a gene or DNA sequence. Variants can be single nucleotide changes (SNPs) or larger deletions, insertions, or duplications.\\n\\n**Association**: A statistical relationship between two variables. In genetics, association studies are used to identify genetic variants that are associated with a particular disease or trait. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich variant from the list is associated with both thoracic aortic aneurysm and abdominal aortic aneurysm? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**rs12917707** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
