This can lead to heart failure.\\n* **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):** A condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively.\\n* **TLR1 (Toll-like receptor 1):**  A protein that plays a role in the innate immune system, recognizing specific bacterial components. \\n* **IL23R (Interleukin-23 receptor):** A protein involved in immune responses, particularly in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.\\n* **HLA-B (Human Leukocyte Antigen-B):** A gene that codes for a protein involved in the immune system\\'s ability to recognize and destroy foreign invaders.\\n* **MYH7 (Myosin Heavy Chain 7):** A gene that codes for a protein crucial for muscle contraction, including the heart muscle. \\n* **HLA-DQA1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQA1):** A gene involved in the immune system\\'s ability to distinguish \"self\" from \"non-self\" cells.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**MYH7** is associated with both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
