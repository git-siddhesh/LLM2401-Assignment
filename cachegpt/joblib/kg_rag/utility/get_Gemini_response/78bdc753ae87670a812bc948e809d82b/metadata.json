Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Collagenous Colitis (CC)**: \\n* A chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by thickening of the collagen layer in the colon\\'s mucosal lining.\\n* Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. \\n* The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve an autoimmune reaction.\\n\\n**Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)**:\\n* A form of lupus that primarily affects the skin.\\n* Symptoms include rashes, sores, and hair loss. \\n* It\\'s an autoimmune disease where the body\\'s immune system attacks its own tissues.\\n\\n**Genetic Variants:**\\n* Variations in the DNA sequence that can be associated with diseases.\\n*  Variants are represented by \"rs\" numbers (e.g., rs2187668).\\n*  Variants can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or other changes in the DNA sequence.\\n\\n**List of Variants:**\\n* **rs2187668:**  Located in the *IL12B* gene.  *IL12B* plays a role in immune responses, and variants in this gene have been linked to various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **rs975730:** Located in the *CTLA4* gene. *CTLA4*  gene is involved in immune regulation and plays a role in T cell activation. Variants in this gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases.\\n* **rs17398575:** Located in the *HLA-DQB1* gene. *HLA-DQB1* is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene, which plays a crucial role in presenting antigens to the immune system. Variants in this gene have been linked to various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **rs229527:** Located in the *IL23R* gene. *IL23R* is a receptor for interleukin-23 (IL-23), a cytokine involved in immune responses. Variants in this gene have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases and other autoimmune conditions.\\n* **rs1537377:** Located in the *TNFAIP3* gene. *TNFAIP3* is a gene that encodes a protein involved in negative regulation of inflammatory signaling. Variants in this gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\nOut of the given list, which Variant is associated with collagenous colitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. \\n\\n**Answer:**  To answer this question, you would need to consult research articles and databases that specifically study genetic associations with collagenous colitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.  This information is not readily available from the general knowledge of the entities.  \\n\\n**Note:** This question requires  a comprehensive review of scientific literature on genetic associations with these diseases.  It\\'s not possible to answer it definitively without access to specialized databases and research papers. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
