It plays a critical role in T cell activation and immune regulation.\\n* **SLC14A2 (Solute Carrier Family 14, Member 2):** This gene encodes a protein that functions as a choline transporter, moving choline across cell membranes. \\n* **HLA-B (Human Leukocyte Antigen-B):**  A gene involved in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign substances, including pathogens and transplanted tissues. \\n* **TNFSF13 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily, Member 13):** Encodes a protein that plays a role in B cell activation and immune response. It is also known as APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand).\\n* **ZEB2 (Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2):** A gene involved in cell differentiation and development. It has been linked to various cancers, including lymphoma. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):** An aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that affects the lymphatic system.\\n* **Allergic Rhinitis:** An inflammatory condition of the nasal passages triggered by allergens, characterized by symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and congestion.\\n\\n**Question:**  Which gene is associated with both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and allergic rhinitis?\\n\\n**Answer:**  **TNFSF13 (APRIL)** has been linked to both DLBCL and allergic rhinitis. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
