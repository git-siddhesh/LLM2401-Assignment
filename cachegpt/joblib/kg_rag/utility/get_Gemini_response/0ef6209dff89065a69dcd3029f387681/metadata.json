Specific alleles of HLA genes can be associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to certain cancers. \\n* **Immune System and Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Collagenous Colitis are complex, involving an interplay of genetic factors, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation. \\n\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nBased on the provided information, **HLA-B** is the most likely gene associated with both cervix carcinoma and collagenous colitis.  This is due to its role in immune response and known associations with various cancers and inflammatory diseases. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
