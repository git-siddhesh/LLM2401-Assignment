This gene is involved in the transport of glutamate, a neurotransmitter, and has been linked to various neurological disorders but not specifically central nervous system cancer.\\n* **KITLG:**  KIT Ligand. This gene encodes a protein involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, particularly in hematopoietic cells. It has been implicated in certain cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), but not specifically central nervous system cancer or triple-receptor negative breast cancer.\\n* **CAPN14:** Calpain-14. This gene encodes a calcium-dependent cysteine protease involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell signaling. It has been associated with some cancers, but not specifically central nervous system cancer or triple-receptor negative breast cancer.\\n* **CACNA2D1:** Calcium Channel, Voltage-Dependent, Alpha 2/Delta Subunit 1. This gene encodes a subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, crucial for neuronal and muscle function. It has been associated with several neurological disorders, but not specifically central nervous system cancer.\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase. This gene encodes a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length, which is essential for cellular replication and aging. Overexpression of TERT is linked to various cancers, including central nervous system cancers and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Central Nervous System Cancer:** A broad term for cancers arising in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. It encompasses various types like glioblastoma, meningioma, and neuroblastoma.\\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC):**  A subtype of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or HER2, making it more aggressive and difficult to treat. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the given list is associated with both central nervous system cancer and triple-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with central nervous system cancer and triple-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is:  SLC17A4,  KITLG,  CAPN14, CACNA2D1, TERT\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
