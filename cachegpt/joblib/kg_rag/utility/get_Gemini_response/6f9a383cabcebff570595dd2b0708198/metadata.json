It's role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not well-established. \\n* **ARMS2:** This gene is primarily associated with age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease. No direct link to IBD or Crohn's disease is known. \\n* **RORA:** This gene encodes a nuclear receptor involved in regulating circadian rhythm and immune function. It is implicated in IBD and Crohn's disease, particularly in influencing the severity of inflammation. \\n* **MORC4:** This gene's function is not fully understood, but it's involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. While some research suggests potential involvement in IBD, it's not a well-established association.\\n* **IL23R:** This gene encodes the interleukin-23 receptor, a crucial component in the immune system. IL23R plays a central role in the pathogenesis of both IBD and Crohn's disease, promoting inflammation and gut dysbiosis.\\n\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**IL23R** is the gene most strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Crohn's disease. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
