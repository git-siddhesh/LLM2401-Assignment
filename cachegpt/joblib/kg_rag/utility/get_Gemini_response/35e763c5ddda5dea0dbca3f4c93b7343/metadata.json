Mutations in CFH are associated with various autoimmune diseases, including age-related macular degeneration.\\n* **XBP1 (X-box Binding Protein 1):**  A gene involved in the unfolded protein response pathway, which helps cells cope with stress and protein misfolding. Mutations in XBP1 can lead to various diseases, including diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. \\n* **ERAP1 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1):**  A gene involved in processing peptides for presentation by the immune system. ERAP1 is implicated in autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.\\n* **SYT14 (Synaptotagmin 14):** A gene involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses. It is not directly associated with inflammatory diseases like AS or uveitis.\\n* **HNF1B (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta):** A gene involved in the development of various organs, including the pancreas, kidneys, and eyes. Mutations in HNF1B can cause different diseases, including diabetes and kidney problems.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which gene from the list is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitis?** \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**ERAP1** is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
