While not the only gene involved, it plays a role in telomere maintenance and is frequently found to be dysregulated in these conditions. \\n* **TNFSF15** is associated with inflammation and can be involved in various cancers, but not specifically IPF or ER-negative breast cancer.\\n* **NTM** refers to a group of bacteria and is not a gene.\\n* **IGF2BP2** and **STN1** are less likely to be directly associated with these specific diseases based on current research. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
