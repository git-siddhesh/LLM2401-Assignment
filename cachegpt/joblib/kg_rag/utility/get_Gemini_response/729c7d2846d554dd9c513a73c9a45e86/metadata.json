It is often associated with autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCAs).\\n* **Autoimmune disease:** This is a broad category of diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.\\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **PTPN22 (rs429358):**  This variant is known to be associated with increased susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes.  However, its association with AAV is not well-established.\\n* **STAT4 (rs6679677):** This variant has been linked to increased risk of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. There is some evidence suggesting its possible role in AAV susceptibility, but more research is needed. \\n\\n**Note:** While several variants have been linked to autoimmune diseases, the specific association with AAV is complex and not fully understood. Further research is needed to confirm the roles of these variants in AAV development.\\n\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis and autoimmune disease?**\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**rs6679677 (in STAT4) has been linked to autoimmune diseases, including a possible role in AAV susceptibility, but more research is needed.** \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
