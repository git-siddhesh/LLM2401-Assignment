While it's involved in immune pathways, it's not directly linked to MDS or herpes zoster.\\n* **HLA-B:** This gene encodes a protein that is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) which plays a crucial role in the immune system. Certain HLA-B alleles have been associated with an increased risk of developing MDS. However, it's not directly associated with herpes zoster.\\n* **ATP2B1:** This gene encodes a protein involved in calcium transport across cell membranes. It's not directly linked to MDS or herpes zoster.\\n* **SLC14A2:** This gene encodes a protein that transports chloride ions across cell membranes. It's not directly linked to MDS or herpes zoster.\\n* **KALRN:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the formation of the nervous system. It's not directly linked to MDS or herpes zoster.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the listed genes, **HLA-B** is the gene associated with **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)**. None of the listed genes are directly associated with **Herpes Zoster**. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
