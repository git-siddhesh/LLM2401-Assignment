Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with increased risk of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. It is **not** directly linked to lung squamous cell carcinoma.\\n* **CCDC33:** A gene encoding a coiled-coil domain-containing protein. **CCDC33 has been linked to lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).** It is believed to play a role in cell proliferation and migration. \\n* **IGF1R:** Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and development. While IGF1R overexpression is linked to various cancers, **its direct association with LSCC is unclear.**\\n* **XBP1:** A gene involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response mechanism. **XBP1 has been implicated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)** and its role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy.\\n\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LSCC):** A type of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by squamous cell differentiation.\\n* **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that originates in squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells that line the surface of many organs.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the given list, **CCDC33 and XBP1** are associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
