Specific genes associated with immune system regulation and response to allergens are implicated.\\n* **Key Genes:**  \\n    * **HLA genes (HLA-B, HLA-DQB1):**  Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), responsible for immune system recognition of foreign antigens. Variations in these genes affect individual immune responses to allergens.\\n    * **CHST11:** Involved in sulfation, a process modifying the immune response to allergens.\\n    * **RELN:**  Not directly associated with allergic rhinitis.\\n\\n**Herpes Zoster:**\\n\\n* **Definition:**  A viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. It manifests as a painful rash and blisters typically in a localized area of the body, often affecting a single dermatome.\\n* **Genetics:**  Genetic factors can influence susceptibility to herpes zoster, although the specific genes involved are not fully understood. \\n* **Key Genes:**  \\n    * **HLA genes (HLA-B):**  Variations in HLA-B have been linked to increased susceptibility to herpes zoster.\\n    * **TP53:** Not directly associated with herpes zoster. \\n\\n**Genes in the list:**\\n\\n* **CHST11:**  Involved in sulfation, potentially relevant to allergic rhinitis.\\n* **HLA-B:**  Associated with both allergic rhinitis and herpes zoster, likely through its role in immune responses.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:**  Associated with allergic rhinitis, linked to immune responses to allergens.\\n* **RELN:**  Not directly associated with either condition.\\n* **TP53:**  A tumor suppressor gene, not relevant to allergic rhinitis or herpes zoster.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-B** is associated with both allergic rhinitis and herpes zoster. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
