Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**PNPLA3:** \\n* **Full name:** Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3\\n* **Function:**  Plays a role in triglyceride metabolism and lipid storage within the liver.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  Genetic variants in the PNPLA3 gene are strongly associated with increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver cirrhosis. \\n\\n**SULT1B1:**\\n* **Full name:** Sulfotransferase family 1B member 1\\n* **Function:**  Enzymes involved in the detoxification of various substances, including steroids and hormones.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  While  SULT1B1 plays a role in detoxification, its specific association with NAFLD/NASH and liver cirrhosis is not as strong or well-studied as PNPLA3.\\n\\n**KIT:**\\n* **Full name:**  KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase\\n* **Function:**  This gene codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation. \\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  KIT is not directly associated with NAFLD/NASH or liver cirrhosis. Its primary association is with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).\\n\\n**AHR:**\\n* **Full name:**  Aryl hydrocarbon receptor\\n* **Function:**  A transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in detoxification, cell growth, and immune responses.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  Limited evidence suggests AHR may be involved in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, but its role in NAFLD/NASH and cirrhosis is not fully understood.\\n\\n**FAM227B:**\\n* **Full name:** Family with sequence similarity 227 member B\\n* **Function:**  The exact function of FAM227B is unknown. It is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in cell signaling.\\n* **Association with Liver Disease:**  No known direct association with NAFLD/NASH or liver cirrhosis.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene most strongly associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
