Disease breast cancer presents Symptom Neoplasm of the breast\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN):** A group of blood cancers characterized by the overproduction of one or more blood cell types in the bone marrow.\\n\\n**Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancer:** A type of cancer that affects the brain and spinal cord. \\n\\n**Genes:**\\n* **WNT4:** A gene involved in embryonic development and cell signaling. Mutations in WNT4 have been linked to certain types of cancer, including breast cancer, but not specifically MPN or CNS cancer.\\n* **TERT:** The gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres (protective caps on the ends of chromosomes).  TERT mutations have been linked to a variety of cancers, including MPN and CNS cancer.\\n* **VAV3:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in cell signaling.  While VAV3 mutations are involved in some cancers, it's not specifically linked to MPN or CNS cancer.\\n* **ADH1B:** A gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for alcohol metabolism. It's not directly linked to MPN or CNS cancer. \\n* **GATA3:** A gene that encodes a transcription factor important for immune system development. GATA3 mutations have been linked to breast cancer and other cancers, but not specifically MPN or CNS cancer.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm and central nervous system cancer?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
