Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n* **USHBP1:**  This gene encodes a protein that is involved in the process of usher syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects hearing and vision. It is not directly associated with uveal melanoma or head and neck cancer.\\n* **BARD1:** This gene encodes a protein that interacts with BRCA1, another tumor suppressor gene.  Mutations in BARD1 have been linked to an increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers. While not directly linked to uveal melanoma or head and neck cancer, it is associated with other cancers and tumor suppression.\\n* **GNE:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the synthesis of sialic acid, a sugar molecule crucial for various cellular functions.  Mutations in GNE are associated with a rare disorder called sialidosis, which affects various organ systems.  It's not directly linked to uveal melanoma or head and neck cancer.\\n* **CACNA2D1:** This gene encodes a protein that plays a role in the function of calcium channels, which are involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and hormone release. While not directly associated with uveal melanoma or head and neck cancer, some studies have suggested potential links with certain types of cancer.\\n* **SAMM50:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the process of protein folding and transport within the endoplasmic reticulum, a cellular organelle. Mutations in SAMM50 have been linked to a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, which affects bone development.  It is not directly linked to uveal melanoma or head and neck cancer.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with uveal melanoma and head and neck cancer?**\\n\\n**Answer:** None of the genes in the list are directly associated with uveal melanoma and head and neck cancer. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
