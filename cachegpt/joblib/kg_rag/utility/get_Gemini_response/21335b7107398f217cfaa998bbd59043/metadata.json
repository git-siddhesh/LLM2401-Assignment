It is associated with various cardiomyopathies.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II, involved in immune response by presenting antigens to T cells.  Variations in HLA-DQA1 are linked to autoimmune disorders.\\n* **TERT:**  Encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds repetitive sequences to the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation.  Mutations in TERT are associated with various cancers and aging-related diseases.\\n* **BARD1:**  A tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Mutations in BARD1 are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Collagenous Colitis:** An inflammatory bowel disease characterized by thickened collagen layer in the colon wall.\\n* **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus:**  A chronic autoimmune disease affecting the skin, characterized by inflammation and skin rashes. \\n\\n**Connection:**\\n\\n* **HLA-DQA1**  has been associated with both collagenous colitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus due to its role in the immune system and its association with various autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is associated with collagenous colitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
