For example:**\\n\\n* **GWAS Catalog:** A database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that identify SNPs associated with different traits and diseases.\\n* **ClinVar:** A database of clinically relevant variations in the human genome.\\n\\n**Without access to such databases, I cannot definitively answer which variant is associated with aortic stenosis and large artery stroke.** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with aortic stenosis and large artery stroke.
