It has been linked to resistance to chemotherapy in various cancers, including breast cancer.\\n* **GATA3:** A gene encoding a transcription factor involved in breast development and function. Mutations in GATA3 are associated with **estrogen receptor-positive** breast cancer.\\n* **TP53:** A tumor suppressor gene.  Mutations in TP53 are found in many types of cancer, including breast cancer and lung carcinoma.\\n* **TERT:** A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme involved in DNA replication and maintaining telomere length.  TERT is overexpressed in various cancers, including lung cancer and breast cancer.\\n* **PLA2G6:** A gene encoding a phospholipase enzyme involved in inflammation.  While PLA2G6 has been linked to some cancers, it is not specifically associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer or lung carcinoma. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TP53** is associated with both estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer and lung carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lung carcinoma. Given list is:  ABCG2,  GATA3,  TP53, TERT, PLA2G6'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
