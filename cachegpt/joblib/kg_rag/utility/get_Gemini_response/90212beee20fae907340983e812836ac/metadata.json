Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TLR1:** Toll-like receptor 1.  Plays a role in innate immune response to bacterial infections.\\n* **SLC14A2:** Solute carrier family 14 (sodium-dependent choline transporter), member 2. Primarily involved in cholinergic neurotransmission.\\n* **SCN1A:** Sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1.  Crucial for neuronal excitability and function.\\n* **IL12RB2:** Interleukin 12 receptor beta 2. Involved in immune signaling, particularly in response to pathogens.\\n* **PLG:** Plasminogen.  A key component of the fibrinolytic system involved in blood clot breakdown.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Mature B-cell neoplasm:** A type of cancer arising from mature B lymphocytes (white blood cells).\\n* **Cocaine dependence:** A chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use.\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\nBased on the available information, **IL12RB2** is likely the gene associated with mature B-cell neoplasm and cocaine dependence. \\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n* **IL12RB2** plays a role in immune signaling and has been linked to several cancers, including lymphomas which are a type of B-cell neoplasm.\\n*  Cocaine dependence is associated with altered immune responses and inflammation. IL12RB2 has been implicated in inflammation and immune dysregulation.\\n\\n**Note:** While this is a plausible answer, further research is needed to definitively confirm the association of IL12RB2 with both mature B-cell neoplasm and cocaine dependence. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
