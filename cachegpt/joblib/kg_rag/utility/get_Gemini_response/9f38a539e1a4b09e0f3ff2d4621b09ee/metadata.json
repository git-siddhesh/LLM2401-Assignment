They are often associated with disease risk and drug responses.\\n\\n**SNPs and Disease Associations:**  Variations in SNPs can influence an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases. Researchers study the association of specific SNPs with disease prevalence to understand genetic factors contributing to disease development.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich SNP from the list (rs11759064, rs975730, rs1150757, rs2294008, rs7453920) is associated with both gastric fundus cancer and duodenal ulcer? \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
