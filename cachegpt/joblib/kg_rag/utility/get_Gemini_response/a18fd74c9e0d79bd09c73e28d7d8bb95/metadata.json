Not directly linked to allergic rhinitis or psoriasis. \\n- **ADH1B:**  Encodes an enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism.  No connection to allergic rhinitis or psoriasis. \\n- **HLA-B:**  Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), involved in immune system function.  **Known to be associated with both allergic rhinitis and psoriasis.**\\n- **PKNOX2:**  A transcription factor involved in development.  Some studies suggest potential involvement in skin disorders, but not definitively linked to allergic rhinitis or psoriasis. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene associated with both allergic rhinitis and psoriasis from the given list is **HLA-B**. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
