It's known to interact with the EGF receptor signaling pathway, which is important in cell proliferation.\\n* **CFH (Complement Factor H):** A key regulator of the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps fight infections.  CFH is involved in the control of inflammation and prevents the complement system from attacking healthy cells.\\n* **ABO (ABO blood group):**  A gene that determines blood type. It's not directly involved in disease development but can influence the risk of certain conditions through its role in blood transfusions and immune response.\\n* **KALRN (Kalirin):**  A protein involved in neuronal development and function. It plays a role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of neurons to change their connections and function.\\n* **STAT6 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6):**  A transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. It plays a key role in immune responses, particularly those involving Th2 cells.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Duodenal Ulcer:** A sore in the lining of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. It's commonly caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria or by long-term use of NSAID medications.\\n* **Pancreatic Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that arises in the pancreas, a gland located in the abdomen. It's a very aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.\\n\\n**Question:**  Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with duodenal ulcer and pancreatic carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\nNone of the genes listed are directly associated with duodenal ulcer and pancreatic carcinoma. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with duodenal ulcer and pancreatic carcinoma.
