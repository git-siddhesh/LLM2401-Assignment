Disease alcoholic liver cirrhosis resembles Disease fatty liver disease\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **HYKK:**  This gene encodes a kinase involved in energy metabolism. It is not directly linked to liver cirrhosis or NAFLD.\\n* **PLA2G6:** This gene encodes a phospholipase enzyme. While implicated in various processes, it is not directly known for its association with liver cirrhosis or NAFLD.\\n* **ADH1B:** This gene encodes an enzyme responsible for alcohol metabolism. It is not directly linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it is related to alcoholic liver disease (ALD).\\n* **PNPLA3:** This gene encodes a protein involved in triglyceride metabolism. This gene has been extensively studied and is a major genetic risk factor for both NAFLD and liver cirrhosis. \\n* **RGS14:** This gene encodes a protein involved in regulating G protein signaling pathways. While this gene has been linked to various metabolic conditions, its specific connection to liver cirrhosis or NAFLD is not well established.\\n\\n**Liver Conditions:**\\n\\n* **Liver Cirrhosis:**  A late stage of scarring of the liver, caused by chronic liver damage. \\n* **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD):** A condition characterized by fat accumulation in the liver, not caused by excessive alcohol consumption.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene most strongly associated with both liver cirrhosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with liver cirrhosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Given list is:  HYKK, PLA2G6,  ADH1B, PNPLA3,  RGS14'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
