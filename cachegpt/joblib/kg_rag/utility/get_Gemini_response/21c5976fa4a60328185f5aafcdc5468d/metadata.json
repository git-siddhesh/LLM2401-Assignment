It is implicated in several cancers, including melanoma and glioblastoma, but not specifically known to be associated with central nervous system cancers or interstitial lung disease.\\n* **TENM2 (Tenascin-M2)**: This gene encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion and migration. It is known to be associated with certain types of cancer, including lung cancer, but not specifically interstitial lung disease.\\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)**: This gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in telomere maintenance.  It is known to be associated with cancer development, including central nervous system cancers, and is also implicated in some cases of interstitial lung disease.\\n* **LRMDA (Leucine-Rich Repeat and Motile Domain-Containing Protein A)**: This gene encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling. It is not currently known to be specifically associated with central nervous system cancers or interstitial lung disease. \\n* **CCDC33 (Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 33)**: This gene encodes a protein involved in ciliogenesis (formation of cilia). It is not currently known to be specifically associated with central nervous system cancers or interstitial lung disease.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the given list, **TERT** is most strongly associated with central nervous system cancer and interstitial lung disease. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
