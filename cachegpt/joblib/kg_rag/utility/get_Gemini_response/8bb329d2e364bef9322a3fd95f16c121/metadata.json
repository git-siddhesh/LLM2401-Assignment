Not directly associated with CLE or IgA deficiency.\\n* IL10:  Interleukin 10, a cytokine involved in immune regulation. Plays a role in inhibiting inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.\\n* TNXB:  Tenascin XB, a protein involved in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. Not directly associated with CLE or IgA deficiency.\\n* FAM13A:  Family with sequence similarity 13, member A, a gene with an unknown function. Not directly associated with CLE or IgA deficiency.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:**  Human leukocyte antigen DQ alpha 1, a gene involved in antigen presentation. Variations in HLA-DQA1 are associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including CLE. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich Gene is associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and immunoglobulin alpha deficiency?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. While not directly associated with immunoglobulin alpha deficiency, HLA genes are involved in immune system function and may indirectly influence other immune deficiencies. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
