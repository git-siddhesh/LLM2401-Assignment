Variant rs34090353 associates Disease type 1 diabetes mellitus\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **C9:**  This gene is associated with Huntington's disease, not lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer. \\n* **GNE:** This gene is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acid, a sugar important for cell function. Mutations in GNE are associated with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), a rare muscle disorder. It is not associated with lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n* **CDKAL1:** This gene is linked to type 2 diabetes, not lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that helps maintain the ends of chromosomes. **Mutations in TERT are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including lung carcinoma and central nervous system cancers.**\\n* **PTPN22:** This gene plays a role in the immune system. Mutations in PTPN22 have been linked to autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, but not lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Lung carcinoma:** This is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs. \\n* **Central nervous system cancer:** This is a broad term encompassing cancers that arise in the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the central nervous system.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with lung carcinoma and central nervous system cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung carcinoma and central nervous system cancer. Given list is:  C9,  GNE,  CDKAL1, TERT, PTPN22\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
