Mutations in this gene have been linked to some types of cancer. \\n* **SYT14:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Its role in cancer and autoimmune diseases is not extensively studied.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which Gene is associated with rheumatic heart disease and oral cavity cancer?** \\n\\n**Answer:**  \\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** has been associated with both rheumatic heart disease and oral cavity cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with rheumatic heart disease and oral cavity cancer. Given list is: HLA-DQB1, IL23R,  TM6SF2,  BTC,  SYT14\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
