They can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or larger deletions/insertions. \\n* **rsID:** A unique identifier assigned to each genetic variation, often SNPs. \\n* **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA):** A localized dilation or bulging in the abdominal aorta, the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the abdomen.\\n* **Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA):** A localized dilation or bulging in the thoracic aorta, the section of the aorta that runs through the chest. \\n* **Association:**  A statistical relationship between a genetic variant and a disease or trait. This does not mean causation but suggests that the variant might be involved in the disease development.\\n\\n## Question: \\n\\nWhich variant from the list is associated with both abdominal aortic aneurysm and thoracic aortic aneurysm? \\n\\n**Please provide me with the scientific literature that links the variant to these specific diseases.**  I need that information to answer your question accurately. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
