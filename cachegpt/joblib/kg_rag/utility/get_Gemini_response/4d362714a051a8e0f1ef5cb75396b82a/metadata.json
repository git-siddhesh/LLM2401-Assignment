Telomerase activity is often elevated in cancer cells, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely.\\n* **KIT:** This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in KIT can lead to various cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and some types of leukemia.\\n* **DGKK:** This gene encodes diacylglycerol kinase kappa, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is a second messenger that plays a role in cell signaling.\\n* **ATP2B1:** This gene encodes a calcium pump protein that is responsible for transporting calcium ions across cell membranes. ATP2B1 plays a role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and cell signaling.\\n* **IL6:** This gene encodes interleukin 6, a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation, immune response, and cell growth. IL6 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory diseases.\\n\\n**Cancer Types:**\\n\\n* **Triple-receptor negative breast cancer:** This type of breast cancer does not express the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  It is often more aggressive than other types of breast cancer.\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:** This type of breast cancer does not express the estrogen receptor (ER). It is often more aggressive than ER-positive breast cancer.\\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\nWhich gene from the given list is associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\n**IL6** is the gene associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is: TERT,  KIT,  DGKK, ATP2B1,  IL6\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
