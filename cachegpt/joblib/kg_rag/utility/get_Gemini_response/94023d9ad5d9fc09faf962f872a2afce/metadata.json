Gene UGT2A1 expressedin Disease lung cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **BTBD9 (BTB/POZ Domain Containing 9):**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its role in cancer is still being investigated.\\n* **NTM (Notch Transcriptional Modulator):** A gene involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell development and differentiation. Alterations in the NTM gene can contribute to various cancers, including lung cancer.\\n* **RP1 (Ribosomal Protein 1):** A gene that codes for a component of ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. Alterations in RP1 have been linked to various cancers, including breast cancer.\\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):** A gene encoding a key enzyme in the telomere maintenance pathway, which protects the ends of chromosomes. Overexpression of TERT has been linked to various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer.\\n* **CASZ1 (Cancer Associated Zinc Finger Protein 1):** A gene that encodes a protein involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is known to be overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer. \\n\\n**Cancer Types:**\\n\\n* **Lung Adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that originates in the glandular tissue of the lungs.\\n* **Triple-Receptor Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):** A subtype of breast cancer characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung adenocarcinoma and triple-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
