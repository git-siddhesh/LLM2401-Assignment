Variations in HLA genes are associated with a range of autoimmune diseases and susceptibility to infections.\\n* **YLPM1:** This gene is not directly linked to either lymphoma or hepatitis B. It is associated with the formation of yolk sac tumors.\\n* **MTTP:** This gene encodes the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for the production of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and the absorption of dietary fat.  No known direct association with lymphoma or hepatitis B.\\n* **HAAO:** This gene encodes histidine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of histidine. It's not known to have a direct role in either lymphoma or hepatitis B.\\n* **PTPN22:** This gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in regulating the immune response. It's been linked to autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. \\n* **Lymphoma:** A type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, primarily affecting white blood cells. It can be associated with viral infections like Epstein-Barr virus.\\n* **Hepatitis B:** A viral infection affecting the liver, potentially leading to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\nBased on the information provided, **HLA-DQB2** is the gene associated with lymphoma and hepatitis B. While it is not directly causal, variations in HLA-DQB2 are known to influence immune responses and susceptibility to various diseases, including those mentioned. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
