It has been linked to various autoimmune disorders, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.\\n* **LACC1:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion and migration. It is associated with several cancers and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.\\n* **TNXB:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the extracellular matrix. It has been implicated in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and muscular dystrophy.\\n* **UMPS:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in purine metabolism. It is associated with several genetic disorders, including Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and gout.\\n* **SFRP4:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in cell signaling and development. It is implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders.\\n\\n**Neurological Disorders:**\\n\\n* **Neurotic Disorder:** A broad category of mental disorders characterized by anxiety, fear, and emotional distress. It encompasses a variety of conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\\n* **Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO):** A rare autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system, primarily targeting the optic nerves and spinal cord, leading to vision loss and paralysis.\\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **STAT4 and NMO:** There is strong evidence suggesting a link between STAT4 gene variations and the risk of developing NMO. Studies have shown that certain STAT4 variants are associated with increased susceptibility to this disease.\\n* **Neurotic Disorder and Genes:** The genetic basis of neurotic disorders is complex and involves multiple genes. While research is ongoing, there is no specific gene definitively linked to neurotic disorders.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with neurotic disorder and neuromyelitis optica?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**STAT4** is the only gene from the list that has a clear association with **neuromyelitis optica**. While there is no single gene definitively linked to **neurotic disorder**, STAT4 is implicated in autoimmune disorders, which can sometimes contribute to mental health conditions. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
