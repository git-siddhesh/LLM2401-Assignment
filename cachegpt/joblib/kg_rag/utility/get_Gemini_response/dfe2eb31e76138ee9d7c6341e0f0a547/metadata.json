It shares many of the same risk factors as female breast cancer, such as family history and genetic mutations. \\n\\n**Breast Carcinoma:** This is the most common type of breast cancer. It is a malignant tumor arising from the epithelial cells of the breast. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Variant is associated with male breast cancer and breast carcinoma?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**rs34574566 (in BRCA2) is the strongest candidate associated with both male breast cancer and breast carcinoma.**  While other variants may have some association with breast cancer, BRCA2 mutations are well-established high-penetrance risk factors for both male and female breast cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
