Plays a role in cancer development and progression.\\n* **SLC14A2 (Solute Carrier Family 14, Member 2):**  Encodes a protein involved in transporting chloride ions across cell membranes. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidney and plays a role in fluid balance.\\n\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Cocaine Dependence:**  A chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite harmful consequences.  \\n* **Mature B-Cell Neoplasm:**  A broad category of cancers that originate from mature B-cells, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune system. This includes various lymphomas and leukemias.\\n\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TP63** is associated with both cocaine dependence and mature B-cell neoplasm. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
