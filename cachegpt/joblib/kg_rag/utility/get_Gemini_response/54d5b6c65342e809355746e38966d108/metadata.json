Gene MIR23B associates Disease liver cirrhosis\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge for each Gene:\\n\\n* **IL23R:**  The Interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) is a protein that plays a role in the immune system, particularly in inflammation.  \\n* **RP1:**  RP1 is a gene related to retinitis pigmentosa, a rare genetic eye disease. It's not directly linked to liver diseases.\\n* **PSCA:**  Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is associated with prostate cancer and some other cancers. It has no known connection to liver diseases.\\n* **PNPLA3:**  Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) is a key gene in lipid metabolism and is strongly associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. \\n* **PLG:**  Plasminogen (PLG) is a protein involved in blood clotting and wound healing. It is not specifically linked to liver diseases.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PNPLA3** is the gene associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis. Given list is:  IL23R, RP1,  PSCA, PNPLA3,  PLG\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
