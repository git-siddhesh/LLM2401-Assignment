Variant rs10985070 associates Disease rheumatoid arthritis\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Variants:** \\n* **rs12203592:**  This is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the TYR gene. TYR encodes tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. \\n* **rs10103692:** This SNP is located in the PTPN22 gene. PTPN22 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a role in immune regulation.\\n* **rs78378222:** This SNP is located in the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is involved in immune response and antigen presentation.\\n* **rs2476601:**  This SNP is located in the STAT4 gene, which plays a role in immune cell signaling and cytokine production.\\n* **rs1150757:**  This SNP is located in the IL23R gene. IL23R encodes a receptor for IL-23, a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n**Vitiligo:** \\n* An autoimmune skin disorder characterized by depigmentation patches due to the loss of melanocytes. \\n\\n**Rheumatoid Arthritis:**\\n* An autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints, causing inflammation, pain, stiffness, and joint damage. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich Variant is associated with vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**rs10103692** (in the PTPN22 gene) is associated with both vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis.
