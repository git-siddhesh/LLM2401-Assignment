Disease ontology identifier of HCL-V is DOID:713\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n* **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM):** A condition where the heart\\'s main pumping chamber (left ventricle) becomes enlarged and weakened. This can lead to heart failure.\\n* **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):** A condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively.\\n* **TLR1 (Toll-like receptor 1):**  A protein that plays a role in the innate immune system, recognizing specific bacterial components. \\n* **IL23R (Interleukin-23 receptor):** A protein involved in immune responses, particularly in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.\\n* **HLA-B (Human Leukocyte Antigen-B):** A gene that codes for a protein involved in the immune system\\'s ability to recognize and destroy foreign invaders.\\n* **MYH7 (Myosin Heavy Chain 7):** A gene that codes for a protein crucial for muscle contraction, including the heart muscle. \\n* **HLA-DQA1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DQA1):** A gene involved in the immune system\\'s ability to distinguish \"self\" from \"non-self\" cells.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**MYH7** is associated with both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
