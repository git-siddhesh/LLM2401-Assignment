This gene is associated with heart muscle function, not oral or oropharyngeal cancer.\\n* **KIF1B:** Kinesin family member 1B. This gene is involved in intracellular transport and neuronal development. It is not directly linked to oral or oropharyngeal cancer.\\n* **DGKK:** Diacylglycerol kinase, kappa. This gene plays a role in regulating cell signaling pathways, but is not directly linked to oral or oropharyngeal cancer.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Human leukocyte antigen DQ beta 1. This gene is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is involved in immune system recognition and response. Certain HLA alleles have been associated with an increased risk of various cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma. \\n* **HLA-B:** Human leukocyte antigen B.  Similar to HLA-DQB1, this gene is also part of the MHC. Specific HLA-B alleles have been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\nOut of the given list, **HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B** are genes associated with oral cavity and oropharynx cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
