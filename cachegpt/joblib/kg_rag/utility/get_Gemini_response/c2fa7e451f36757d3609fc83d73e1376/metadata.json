It is not directly associated with pancreatic carcinoma or duodenal ulcers. \\n* **CRTC1:**  This gene encodes for a protein involved in regulating gene expression. While studies suggest its potential role in certain cancers, it is not specifically linked to pancreatic carcinoma.\\n* **CACNB2:** This gene encodes for a protein involved in calcium signaling, specifically in the heart. It is not directly associated with pancreatic carcinoma or duodenal ulcers.\\n* **PSCA:** This gene encodes for a protein that is often overexpressed in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer. It is a potential target for cancer therapy.\\n* **CDK8:**  This gene encodes for a protein involved in cell cycle regulation.  It is implicated in various cancers, but not specifically duodenal ulcers.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Pancreatic Carcinoma:**  A type of cancer that arises in the pancreas. \\n* **Duodenal Ulcer:**  A sore that develops in the lining of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\n**PSCA** is the gene most associated with pancreatic carcinoma. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
