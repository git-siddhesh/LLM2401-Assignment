No known direct association with MPN or lung carcinoma. \\n* **TENM2 (Tenascin-M):**  A gene encoding a protein that plays a role in cell adhesion and migration.  Studies suggest possible association with some cancer types, but not specifically MPN or lung carcinoma.\\n* **DMRT1 (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor 1):**  A gene involved in sex determination and development. Not known to be associated with MPN or lung carcinoma. \\n* **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase):**  A gene encoding a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomere length in chromosomes.  **TERT is known to be associated with various cancers, including MPN and lung carcinoma.** \\n* **UCK2 (Uridine Kinase 2):**  A gene involved in pyrimidine metabolism. Not known to be associated with MPN or lung carcinoma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)** is the gene associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm and lung carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
