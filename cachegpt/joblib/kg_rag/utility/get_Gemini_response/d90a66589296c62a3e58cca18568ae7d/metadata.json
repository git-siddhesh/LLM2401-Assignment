Specific genes associated with the immune response, like those involved in the production of IgE antibodies, are often implicated.\\n\\n**Psoriatic Arthritis:**\\n\\n* **Definition:** A chronic inflammatory disease that affects the joints and skin. It is often associated with psoriasis, a skin condition causing red, scaly patches.\\n* **Genetics:**  Genetic predisposition is a strong factor in developing Psoriatic Arthritis.  Several genes related to the immune system and inflammation are implicated.\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **HLA-B:**  A gene within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) involved in presenting antigens to the immune system.  Mutations or variations in HLA-B can lead to altered immune responses.\\n* **FAM227B:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in cellular signaling and growth.  It has been linked to certain cancers and developmental disorders but not specifically to inflammatory diseases.\\n* **RP1:**  A gene involved in the formation of ribosomes, crucial for protein synthesis. It is not directly associated with inflammatory conditions.\\n* **FTO:**  A gene associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.  It is not directly linked to allergic rhinitis or psoriatic arthritis.\\n* **KIF1B:**  A gene encoding a protein involved in microtubule-based transport within cells.  It is not directly associated with allergic rhinitis or psoriatic arthritis.\\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\n* **Which Gene is associated with allergic rhinitis and psoriatic arthritis?** \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**HLA-B** is the gene associated with both allergic rhinitis and psoriatic arthritis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with allergic rhinitis and psoriatic arthritis.
