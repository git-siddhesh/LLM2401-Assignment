It is associated with immune responses and autoimmune diseases, but its specific role in myositis or scleroderma is not well-established.\\n\\n**DMRT1:** This gene encodes a protein involved in sex determination and development. It is not directly linked to myositis or scleroderma.\\n\\n**STAT4:** This gene encodes a protein called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 4, which is involved in immune system signaling. **STAT4 is associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and other autoimmune diseases**, and its role in myositis is being investigated.\\n\\n**CLPTM1L:** This gene encodes a protein involved in protein transport. It is not directly linked to myositis or scleroderma.\\n\\n**SLC2A9:** This gene encodes a protein involved in glucose transport. It is not directly linked to myositis or scleroderma.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**STAT4** is the gene most likely associated with myositis and systemic scleroderma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
