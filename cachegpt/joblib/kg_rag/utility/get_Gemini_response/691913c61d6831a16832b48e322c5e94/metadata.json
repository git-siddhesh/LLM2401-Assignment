Variations in this gene are linked to various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis.  Additionally, HLA-DQB1's involvement in immune regulation is also implicated in oral cavity cancer susceptibility.\\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
