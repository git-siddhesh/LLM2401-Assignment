Mutations in this gene are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.\\n\\n## Question: \\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with pancreatic carcinoma and malaria?\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**None of the listed genes are directly associated with pancreatic carcinoma and malaria.**  While some genes from the list are involved in immune responses (HLA-DQA1, ABO), they are not known to be directly linked to these specific diseases. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
