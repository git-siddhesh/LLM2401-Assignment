Not directly associated with central nervous system cancer or lung carcinoma.\\n* **GCKR:**  A gene involved in glucose metabolism. Not directly associated with central nervous system cancer or lung carcinoma.\\n* **STAT4:**  A gene involved in the STAT signaling pathway, playing a role in immune responses and cell growth.  It has been implicated in some cancers including lymphoma. \\n* **TERT:**  A gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase is often overactive in cancers, including central nervous system and lung cancer. \\n* **BTN2A1:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in immune regulation and inflammation. While it has some links to certain cancers, it is not directly linked to central nervous system or lung carcinoma.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Central nervous system cancer:** A broad term encompassing various types of cancers affecting the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the nervous system.  \\n* **Lung carcinoma:** A type of cancer that originates in the lung tissue.\\n\\n**Answer:** \\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with central nervous system cancer and lung carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
