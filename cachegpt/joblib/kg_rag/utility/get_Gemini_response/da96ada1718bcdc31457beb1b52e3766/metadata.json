It is also involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which plays a role in immune responses.\\n* **TTLL5:** A gene that encodes a protein that acts as a tubulin tyrosine ligase. It is responsible for adding tyrosine residues to tubulin, which are important for microtubule stability and function.\\n* **TLR1:** A gene that encodes a protein that acts as a Toll-like receptor. It plays a role in the recognition of bacterial lipoproteins and the activation of the innate immune system.\\n* **ALDH1A2:** A gene that encodes a protein that is an aldehyde dehydrogenase. It is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and the synthesis of retinoic acid, which is important for cell growth and differentiation. \\n* **HLA-DQB1:** A gene that encodes a protein that is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. It plays a role in presenting antigens to T cells and is involved in immune responses.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Rheumatic Heart Disease:** An inflammatory condition that affects the heart valves and muscles. It is often a complication of untreated strep throat.\\n* **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** A chronic liver disease that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the liver.\\n\\n**Question:** Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune hepatitis. \\n\\n**Answer:** **HLA-DQB1** is the gene most directly associated with both rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune hepatitis. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
