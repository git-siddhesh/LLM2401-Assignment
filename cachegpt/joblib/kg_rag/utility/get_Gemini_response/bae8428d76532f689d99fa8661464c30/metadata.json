It has not been linked to gastric diseases.\\n* **CDKAL1:** A gene involved in glucose metabolism. While diabetes can be a risk factor for gastric cancer, CDKAL1 itself is not specifically linked to atrophic gastritis or gastric fundus cancer.\\n* **KAT2B:** A gene involved in histone acetylation, a process important for gene regulation. KAT2B has not been linked to gastric diseases.\\n* **PSCA:** A gene that codes for a prostate stem cell antigen. Studies have shown a strong association between PSCA and gastric cancer. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**PSCA** is associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric fundus cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
