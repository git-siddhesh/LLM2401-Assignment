Mutations in JAK2 are associated with certain blood cancers like polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. \\n* **IL6:**  A gene that encodes a protein called interleukin-6. It's a key regulator of immune responses and inflammation. IL6 is involved in various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **HLA-DQA1:** A gene involved in the immune system. It encodes a protein that presents antigens to immune cells. Variations in HLA genes are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.\\n* **HNF1B:** A gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in kidney development and function. Mutations in this gene can lead to various kidney diseases, including glomerular disease.\\n* **ZEB2:** A gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation and development. It plays a role in the development of various tissues, including the skin and kidneys.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE):**  An autoimmune disease characterized by skin rashes and other symptoms. It is a milder form of lupus.\\n* **Membranous Glomerulonephritis (MGN):**  A kidney disease characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. It can lead to proteinuria and kidney failure.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\nThe gene associated with both Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus and Membranous Glomerulonephritis is **HLA-DQA1**.\\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
