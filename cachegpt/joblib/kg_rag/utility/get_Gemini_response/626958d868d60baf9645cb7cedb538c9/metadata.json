Variants:** These are genetic variations, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are variations at a single nucleotide position in the genome. They are identified by a unique code, like \"rs2812378\".\\n\\n**2. Anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis (AAV):**  A group of autoimmune diseases that target the small blood vessels, often leading to inflammation and damage.  AAV is classified into different types like Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and microscopic polyangiitis.\\n\\n**3. Keratinocyte carcinoma:**  A type of skin cancer that develops in keratinocytes, the main cells of the epidermis (outer layer of skin). It is the most common form of skin cancer and usually arises from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\n**4. rs2812378, rs17145188, rs12931267, rs6679677, rs12413409:** These are specific SNP identifiers, representing single nucleotide variations in the human genome. \\n\\n**Question:** Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis and keratinocyte carcinoma? \\n\\n**Answer:** I need more information to answer this question.  There is no straightforward association between any specific SNP from your list and both anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis and keratinocyte carcinoma.   To answer your question, I need to know the genes these variants are associated with and the current research on their potential links to these diseases. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
