It is involved in multiple signaling pathways and has been implicated in various cancers.\\n* **BTNL2:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune system. It's a member of the butyrophilin family and might have a role in modulating immune responses.\\n* **HLA-B:** A gene within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that encodes a protein involved in the presentation of antigens to the immune system. Variations in HLA-B are associated with numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders and infections.\\n* **HERC2:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA repair, ubiquitination, and immune regulation.  Mutations in this gene are linked to several diseases, including Fanconi anemia and certain types of cancer.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** A gene within the MHC that encodes a protein involved in antigen presentation. Like HLA-B, it has been linked to various diseases.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS):** A group of blood disorders characterized by impaired production of blood cells in the bone marrow.\\n* **Psoriatic arthritis (PsA):**  A chronic inflammatory condition that affects the joints, skin, and nails. It is associated with psoriasis, an autoimmune skin condition.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the given list, **HLA-B** is associated with both myelodysplastic syndrome and psoriatic arthritis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and psoriatic arthritis.
