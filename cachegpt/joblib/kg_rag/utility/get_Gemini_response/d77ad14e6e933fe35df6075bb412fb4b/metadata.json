Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **FBN1:**  Fibrillin-1, a gene responsible for producing a protein that is a key component of microfibrils, which are found in connective tissues throughout the body. Mutations in FBN1 are associated with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting connective tissues.\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase reverse transcriptase, a gene that encodes a protein involved in the maintenance of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Mutations in TERT can lead to increased telomerase activity, which is associated with cancer development.\\n* **DLEU7:**  Deleted in leukemia 7, a gene that is often deleted in various types of leukemia. Its exact function is still not fully understood, but it is thought to play a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation.\\n* **IL2RA:**  Interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha, a gene that encodes a protein that is part of the receptor for interleukin-2, a cytokine involved in immune system regulation. Mutations in IL2RA can lead to various immune system disorders, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\\n* **PTK2B:**  Protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell signaling pathways. Mutations in PTK2B are associated with various cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs):** A group of blood cancers characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of blood cells in the bone marrow. \\n* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** A chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue.  The cause of IPF is unknown.\\n\\n**Question:** Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\n**Answer:** **TERT** is associated with both myeloproliferative neoplasm and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
