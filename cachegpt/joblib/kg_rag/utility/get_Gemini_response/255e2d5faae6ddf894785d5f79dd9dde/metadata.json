Genes are located on chromosomes and consist of DNA.\\n* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** A chronic lung disease that causes scarring and stiffening of the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties. It is considered idiopathic because its exact cause is unknown.\\n* **Lung Carcinoma:** A type of cancer that develops in the lungs, most commonly due to smoking.\\n* **ABCG2:**  A gene that encodes for a protein that acts as an efflux transporter, responsible for moving certain molecules out of cells.\\n* **SULT1B1:** A gene that encodes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs and toxins, including steroid hormones.\\n* **ERAP1:** A gene that encodes for an enzyme involved in processing peptides for presentation by the immune system.\\n* **TERT:** A gene that encodes for a subunit of the enzyme telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining the ends of chromosomes.\\n* **CHST11:** A gene that encodes for an enzyme involved in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a component of cartilage.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. \\n\\n**Explanation:** \\n\\nTERT is known to be involved in cell proliferation and aging. Studies have shown that mutations in TERT are associated with increased risk of both IPF and lung cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
