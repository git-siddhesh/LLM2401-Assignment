Telomere shortening is associated with aging and cellular senescence.\\n* **NOD2:** Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2,  plays a role in innate immunity by recognizing bacterial peptidoglycans. \\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Human leukocyte antigen-DQ beta 1,  involved in the immune system's ability to recognize and present antigens. \\n* **SAMM50:**  SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 50,  a protein that is involved in cell signaling and may play a role in cancer development.\\n* **SFRP4:** Secreted frizzled-related protein 4,  a protein that inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth, development, and proliferation.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancer:** A broad category of cancers that arise within the brain, spinal cord, or other parts of the central nervous system. Examples include glioblastoma, meningioma, and astrocytoma.\\n* **Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN):** A group of blood cancers that arise from the bone marrow and cause an overproduction of blood cells, particularly white blood cells. Examples include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with central nervous system cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene most strongly associated with both central nervous system cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
