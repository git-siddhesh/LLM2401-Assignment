Mutations can increase susceptibility.\\n    * **Other Susceptibility Genes:** Many genes have been linked to the condition, but their role is less clear. \\n* **Hormones:** Androgens (testosterone) play a key role.\\n\\n**Mature B-cell Neoplasm (Lymphoma):**\\n* **Genetic Basis:**  Can be caused by specific gene mutations or chromosomal translocations.\\n* **Key Genes:**\\n    * **MYC:**  Often overexpressed in B-cell lymphomas.\\n    * **BCL2:**  Gene involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death); mutations can lead to lymphoma.\\n    * **Other Genes:** Many genes involved in cell cycle regulation and immune function can be mutated in lymphomas.\\n* **Immune System:**  Defects in immune function can contribute to lymphoma development.\\n\\n**Genes in the Given List:**\\n\\n* **TM6SF2:** Primarily associated with liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease).\\n* **HLA-B:** Major histocompatibility complex gene involved in immune function. Associated with several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and certain cancers.\\n* **SLC14A2:**  A sodium-coupled solute transporter;  research is limited and not directly linked to androgenic alopecia or mature B-cell neoplasm.\\n* **PHGDH:** Involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid serine. Some research suggests potential involvement in cancer, but not specifically mature B-cell neoplasm. \\n* **TTLL5:**  A protein involved in the acetylation of microtubules. Limited research; not known to be directly associated with either condition. \\n\\n**Question:** \\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with androgenic alopecia and mature B-cell neoplasm? \\n\\n**Answer:** None of the genes in the list are directly associated with both androgenic alopecia and mature B-cell neoplasm. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with androgenic alopecia and mature B-cell neoplasm.
