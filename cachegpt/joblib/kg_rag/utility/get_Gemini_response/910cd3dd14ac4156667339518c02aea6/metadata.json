Disease interstitial lung disease associates Gene HFE\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge for each entity:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **ADGRG6 (Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G6):**  A gene encoding a protein involved in cell signaling and adhesion. It has been linked to various cancers, but no clear connection to triple-negative breast cancer or interstitial lung disease has been established.\\n* **FGFR2 (Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2):**  A gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Certain mutations in FGFR2 can lead to specific cancers, but not specifically triple-negative breast cancer or interstitial lung disease.\\n* **AFAP1 (Actin filament associated protein 1):** A gene encoding a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation. It has been implicated in cell migration and invasion, and while it's associated with some cancers, there's no clear link to triple-negative breast cancer or interstitial lung disease.\\n* **TERT (Telomerase reverse transcriptase):**  A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme essential for maintaining telomere length in chromosomes.  TERT overexpression is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, but not specifically triple-negative breast cancer or interstitial lung disease.\\n* **YLPM1 (Yippee-like protein 1):**  A gene encoding a protein involved in protein trafficking. While YLPM1 has roles in cell function, there's no established connection to triple-negative breast cancer or interstitial lung disease.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Triple-negative breast cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \\n* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):** A group of lung disorders that involve inflammation and scarring of the interstitium, the space between the air sacs (alveoli) and the blood vessels in the lungs.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nBased on current scientific knowledge, **none** of the listed genes are specifically associated with both triple-negative breast cancer and interstitial lung disease. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
