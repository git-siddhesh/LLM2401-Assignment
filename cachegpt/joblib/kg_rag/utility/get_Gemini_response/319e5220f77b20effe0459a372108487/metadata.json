Variant rs199681533 associates Disease pancreatic carcinoma\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **ABO:**  This gene determines blood type.  It's not directly associated with malaria or pancreatic carcinoma.\\n* **HLA-DPA1:** This gene is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC),  which plays a role in the immune system. Variations in HLA genes can influence susceptibility to certain diseases, including some cancers. \\n* **TNRC6B:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. It has been implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer.\\n* **JAK2:** This gene is involved in signaling pathways critical for cell growth and development. Mutations in JAK2 are linked to various cancers, including leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is not directly linked to malaria.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.  TERT mutations are associated with various cancers, including pancreatic cancer.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Malaria:** This is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium parasites.  It is not directly linked to any of the genes listed.\\n* **Pancreatic Carcinoma:** This is a type of cancer that originates in the pancreas.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TNRC6B and TERT are the genes most strongly associated with pancreatic carcinoma.** \\n\\n**None of the listed genes are directly associated with malaria.**\\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with malaria and pancreatic carcinoma. Given list is: ABO,  HLA-DPA1,  TNRC6B,  JAK2, TERT\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
