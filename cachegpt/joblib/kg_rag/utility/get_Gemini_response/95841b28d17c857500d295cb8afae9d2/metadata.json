Disease central nervous system cancer associates Gene ADAMTS3\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **FER:**  (Feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)  -  A gene involved in cell signaling and growth. It is a tyrosine kinase receptor, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways upon binding to specific ligands.\\n* **CACNA1D:** (Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1D subunit) - A gene encoding a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, critical for calcium influx into cells. These channels are important in various processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion. \\n* **COL22A1:** (Collagen, type XXII, alpha 1) -  A gene responsible for producing a component of collagen, a fibrous protein that provides structural support to tissues. \\n* **TNFSF15:** (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, member 15) -  A gene encoding a cytokine involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammation. It is also linked to immune responses and cancer development.\\n* **TERT:** (Telomerase reverse transcriptase) -  A gene encoding a crucial enzyme responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that lacks the estrogen receptors that are usually targeted by hormone therapies. It is associated with more aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis.\\n* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancer:** A broad term encompassing cancers affecting the brain and spinal cord. This includes a diverse range of tumors with varying characteristics and treatments. \\n\\n**Question:**\\n\\nOut of the given list, which gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and central nervous system cancer? \\n\\n\\n**Note:** \\n\\nThe question is asking for a gene associated with **both** estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and central nervous system cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
