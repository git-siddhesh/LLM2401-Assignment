Certain genes associated with immune response and allergic pathways can influence the risk of developing the condition.\\n\\n**Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):**\\n\\n* **Definition:** DLBCL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.\\n* **Genetics:**  Genetics can contribute to the development of DLBCL.  Mutations in certain genes can disrupt the normal function of B cells, leading to uncontrolled growth and the formation of tumors.\\n\\n**Genes in the List:**\\n\\n* **HLA-B:** This gene encodes a protein involved in the immune system's recognition of antigens, including allergens. HLA-B is associated with immune responses to allergens and has been linked to susceptibility to allergic rhinitis in some studies.  \\n* **CACNA1A:** This gene encodes a subunit of a calcium channel. This gene is associated with various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, but not directly linked to allergic rhinitis or DLBCL.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme involved in the maintenance of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. TERT has been linked to various types of cancer, including DLBCL, due to its role in cellular immortality. \\n* **EPDR1:** This gene encodes a protein involved in photoreceptor development in the eye. It's not directly linked to either allergic rhinitis or DLBCL.\\n* **ATXN2:** This gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, a neurodegenerative disorder. It's not directly linked to either allergic rhinitis or DLBCL.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**Out of the given list, HLA-B is associated with allergic rhinitis and TERT is associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
