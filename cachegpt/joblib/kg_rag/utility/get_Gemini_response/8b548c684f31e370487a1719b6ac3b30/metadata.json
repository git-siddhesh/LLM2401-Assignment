While it's not directly linked to interstitial lung disease (ILD) or lung carcinoma, its role in immune regulation might suggest indirect involvement in these diseases.\\n* **BRCA2:** Primarily known for its role in DNA repair, mutations in BRCA2 are strongly associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  While some studies suggest a potential link to lung cancer, it's not the primary gene associated with lung carcinoma.\\n* **STAT3:** This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in cell growth, survival, and inflammation.  It has been implicated in various cancers, including lung cancer.  Aberrant STAT3 signaling has also been linked to lung fibrosis, a hallmark of ILD.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme involved in maintaining the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.  TERT overexpression is frequently observed in various cancers, including lung cancer, contributing to tumor cell immortality.\\n* **TFAP2B:**  This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in various developmental processes, including lung development.  Mutations in TFAP2B have been associated with various lung diseases, including ILD and lung cancer.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nOut of the given list, **STAT3 and TFAP2B** are associated with interstitial lung disease and lung carcinoma. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
