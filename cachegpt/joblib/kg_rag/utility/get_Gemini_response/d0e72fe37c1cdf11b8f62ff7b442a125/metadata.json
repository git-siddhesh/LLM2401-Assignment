Gene MIR19A associates Disease interstitial lung disease\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **FAM227B:**  A gene involved in cell growth and development. Its role in breast cancer is not well established. \\n* **PTPN22:** This gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a role in the immune system. It has been linked to autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.\\n* **PSCA:**  A gene encoding a cell surface antigen that is overexpressed in several cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung.\\n* **ABO:** This gene encodes the ABO blood group system, which is involved in blood transfusions.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes a component of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is often dysregulated in cancer.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer:**  A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors, making it unresponsive to hormone therapies.\\n* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):** A group of lung diseases that involve inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nWhile all the genes listed are involved in various biological processes,  **none of the listed genes are directly and definitively associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and interstitial lung disease**. \\n\\n**Further Research:**\\n\\nIt is important to note that the association between genes and complex diseases is often multifaceted and requires extensive research. There might be ongoing studies investigating the potential role of these genes in these specific diseases. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and interstitial lung disease.
