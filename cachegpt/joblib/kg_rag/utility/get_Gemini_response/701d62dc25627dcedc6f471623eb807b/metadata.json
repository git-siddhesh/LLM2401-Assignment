It is not known to be associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism.\\n* **MYBPC3 (Myosin Binding Protein C, Fast Type 3)**: This gene is involved in muscle contraction and is associated with cardiomyopathy, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is not known to be associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism.\\n* **FAM227B (Family With Sequence Similarity 227 Member B)**: This gene has a role in cell growth and development. It is not known to be associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism.\\n* **VAV3 (Vav Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 3)**: This gene plays a role in cell signaling, particularly in immune cells. It is not known to be associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism.\\n* **PRNP (Prion Protein)**: This gene encodes for the prion protein, which is involved in neuronal function. It is associated with prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is not known to be associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism.\\n\\n**Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma:** This is a common type of thyroid cancer, characterized by slow growth and good prognosis. \\n\\n**Hypothyroidism:** This is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to a range of symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and depression.\\n\\n**Answer:**  None of the genes in the list are directly associated with thyroid gland papillary carcinoma or hypothyroidism. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
