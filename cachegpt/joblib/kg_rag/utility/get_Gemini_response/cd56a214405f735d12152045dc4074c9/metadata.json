SNPs are common variations in the DNA sequence that occur at a single nucleotide.\\n\\n**Large artery stroke:** A type of ischemic stroke caused by a blockage in a large artery supplying the brain.\\n\\n**Aortic stenosis:** A condition where the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the aorta, narrows.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nPlease provide me with the information about the listed SNPs, specifically their association with cardiovascular conditions. I need to know which SNP is linked to both large artery stroke and aortic stenosis to answer your question. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
