Mutations in GNE are associated with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), a rare muscle disorder. It is not associated with lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n* **CDKAL1:** This gene is linked to type 2 diabetes, not lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n* **TERT:** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that helps maintain the ends of chromosomes. **Mutations in TERT are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including lung carcinoma and central nervous system cancers.**\\n* **PTPN22:** This gene plays a role in the immune system. Mutations in PTPN22 have been linked to autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, but not lung carcinoma or central nervous system cancer.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Lung carcinoma:** This is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs. \\n* **Central nervous system cancer:** This is a broad term encompassing cancers that arise in the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the central nervous system.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** is the gene associated with lung carcinoma and central nervous system cancer. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
