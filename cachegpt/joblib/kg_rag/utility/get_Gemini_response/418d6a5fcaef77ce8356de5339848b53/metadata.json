Variant rs6562760 associates Disease estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TERT:** Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase. This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that adds DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation.\\n* **CACNB2:** Calcium Channel Beta 2 Subunit. This gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-dependent calcium channel, a complex involved in calcium signaling in cells.\\n* **ERAP1:** Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1. This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the processing of peptides, specifically those presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.\\n* **PRKAA1:**  5' AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Alpha 1. This gene encodes a protein kinase that plays a role in energy metabolism, cell growth, and stress responses.\\n* **SHTN1:** Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 1. This gene encodes an enzyme involved in folate metabolism and the conversion of serine to glycine.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):** A group of lung diseases that involve inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. This can lead to difficulty breathing and other respiratory problems.\\n* **Estrogen-Receptor Negative Breast Cancer:** A type of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptors, meaning it does not respond to treatments that block estrogen.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with interstitial lung disease and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT** has been linked to both interstitial lung disease and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with interstitial lung disease and estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Given list is: TERT,  CACNB2,  ERAP1, PRKAA1,  SHTN1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
