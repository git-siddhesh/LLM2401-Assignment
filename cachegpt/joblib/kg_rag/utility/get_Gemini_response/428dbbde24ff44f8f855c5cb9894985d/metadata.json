Variations in HLA genes are linked to various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **TLR1:** Part of the Toll-like receptor family, involved in innate immune responses to bacterial and fungal infections. \\n* **EPDR1:**  A gene involved in the regulation of the retinal pigment epithelium, crucial for vision. \\n* **SHTN1:**  Encodes a protein involved in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone. \\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the given list is associated with allergic rhinitis and limited scleroderma?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-DQB1** is the gene most likely associated with both allergic rhinitis and limited scleroderma due to its role in immune regulation. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with allergic rhinitis and limited scleroderma. Given list is: SNCA,  HLA-DQB1, TLR1,  EPDR1,  SHTN1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
