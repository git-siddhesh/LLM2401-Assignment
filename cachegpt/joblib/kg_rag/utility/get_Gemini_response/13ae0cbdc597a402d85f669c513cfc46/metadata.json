Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with increased risk of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. While BRCA2 mutations are linked to breast cancer, they are not specifically associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.\\n* **SULT1B1:**  An enzyme involved in the metabolism of steroids, including estrogen. Variations in SULT1B1 activity have been linked to breast cancer risk, but not specifically to estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.\\n* **SPRED2:** A signaling protein involved in cell growth and development.  SPRED2 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, but its association with specific subtypes like estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer is not well established. \\n* **CHST11:** An enzyme that modifies proteins by adding a sugar molecule.  CHST11 has been linked to cancer cell growth and metastasis in various cancers, but its association with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer or lung squamous cell carcinoma is not well-documented.\\n* **CCDC33:** A gene with unknown function,  but some studies suggest potential links to cancer development and metastasis, but no specific connection to estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer or lung squamous cell carcinoma is known.\\n\\n## Answer to the Question:\\n\\nNone of the genes listed are specifically associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma. More research is needed to understand the role of these genes in these specific cancer types. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma.
