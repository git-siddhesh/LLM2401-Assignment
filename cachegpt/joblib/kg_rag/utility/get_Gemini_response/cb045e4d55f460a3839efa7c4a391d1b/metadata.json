It is not directly linked to interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n* **ERAP1:**  A gene involved in the processing of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. Some studies suggest a potential link to autoimmune diseases, but not specifically to interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \\n* **RBFOX1:**  A gene crucial for RNA splicing regulation, playing a role in neuronal development. No known direct association with interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n* **NANOS1:**  A gene involved in germ cell development and regulation of cell fate. It is not directly linked to interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n* **TERT:** **This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme essential for maintaining telomere length.** **TERT has been associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).** Studies have shown that TERT expression is altered in ILD and IPF, and some research suggests that TERT may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT is the gene associated with interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.** \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
