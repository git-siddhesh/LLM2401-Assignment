It has been linked to various cancers, including lung, breast, and prostate cancers.\\n* **CASZ1 (Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility Gene 1):**  This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It has been implicated in various cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.\\n* **AKAP6 (A-kinase Anchoring Protein 6):** This gene encodes a protein that anchors protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations. It is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle control.  \\n* **HERC2 (HECT Domain and RCC1-Like Domain Containing Protein 2):** This gene encodes a protein involved in ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins for degradation. It plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and DNA repair.\\n* **IL6 (Interleukin 6):** This gene encodes a cytokine involved in inflammation and immune response. It has been linked to various cancers, including colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer.\\n\\n**Cancers:**\\n\\n* **Oral Cavity Cancer:** This is a type of cancer that develops in the mouth, including the lips, tongue, gums, cheeks, and floor of the mouth.\\n* **Pancreatic Carcinoma:** This is a type of cancer that develops in the pancreas, a gland located in the abdomen that plays a role in digestion.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with oral cavity cancer and pancreatic carcinoma? \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL6** is associated with both oral cavity cancer and pancreatic carcinoma. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
