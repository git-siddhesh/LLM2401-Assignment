Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **HOXD3:**  A homeobox gene involved in development and regulation of various tissues, including the digestive system. It has been linked to some gastrointestinal cancers. \\n* **ATP2B1:** Encodes a calcium pump protein, involved in calcium transport across cell membranes. Mutations in this gene are associated with various diseases, including some neurological disorders. \\n* **PSCA:**  A cell surface antigen, involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. It's often overexpressed in various cancers, including gastric cancer. \\n* **CDK8:** A cyclin-dependent kinase, playing a key role in cell cycle regulation and gene transcription. It has been implicated in cancer development and progression.\\n* **CACNA1A:** Encodes a subunit of the L-type calcium channel, involved in calcium signaling in neurons and other cells. Mutations in this gene cause several neurological disorders.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Atrophic Gastritis:**  Chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, leading to a thinning and loss of gastric glands, resulting in decreased acid production.\\n* **Duodenal Ulcer:** An open sore in the lining of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.\\n\\n**Question:** \\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with **atrophic gastritis** and **duodenal ulcer**?\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n\\nWhile the list includes genes associated with various diseases, none are directly linked to atrophic gastritis and duodenal ulcer.  The association of these diseases with specific genes is complex and still under investigation. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
