Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **SCN1A:**  Encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. This channel is crucial for nerve impulse propagation in the brain. \\n* **ABCG2:**  Encodes a transporter protein responsible for transporting various molecules across cell membranes, including some medications. It is not directly linked to epilepsy.\\n* **DTNB:**  Not a recognized gene name in the biomedical context. This could be a misspelling or an abbreviation. \\n* **LRMDA:**  Encodes a protein involved in lysosomal trafficking and degradation.  Mutations in this gene are linked to various neurological disorders, including some forms of epilepsy.\\n* **CPS1:**  Encodes the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, which plays a role in the urea cycle. While mutations in CPS1 can lead to metabolic disorders, they are not directly associated with epilepsy.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Focal epilepsy:** A type of epilepsy characterized by seizures originating in a specific area of the brain.\\n* **Epilepsy:**  A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**SCN1A and LRMDA** are genes associated with both focal epilepsy and epilepsy. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
