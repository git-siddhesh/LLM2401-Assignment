Genes are made up of DNA and are located on chromosomes.\\n\\n**Ulcerative colitis (UC):** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and rectum. It is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the colon.\\n\\n**Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):** A group of inflammatory conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The most common types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\\n\\n**SAMD9L:**  A gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes, including DNA repair and regulation of gene expression. \\n\\n**IL23R:**  A gene that encodes a protein that is a receptor for the cytokine IL-23. IL-23 plays a role in the immune response and is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\\n**GATA3:** A gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the development of the immune system.\\n\\n**DNMT3A:**  A gene that encodes a DNA methyltransferase enzyme involved in the regulation of gene expression.\\n\\n**RAD51B:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in homologous recombination, a DNA repair pathway.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene from the list is associated with ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease?\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL23R** \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Given list is: SAMD9L, IL23R,  GATA3,  DNMT3A,  RAD51B\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
