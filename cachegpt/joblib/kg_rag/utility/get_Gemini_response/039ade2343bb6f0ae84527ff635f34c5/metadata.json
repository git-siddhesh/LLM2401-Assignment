These variations are identified by \"rs\" numbers, for example, rs4939827. Each rs number corresponds to a specific location in the genome. \\n\\n**Association:** In genetics, association refers to the statistical relationship between a genetic variant (like an SNP) and a trait or disease. \\n\\n## Question: \\nWhich SNP, from the given list, is associated with both cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and collagenous colitis (CC)? \\n\\n**Note:**  It\\'s important to remember that the information provided here is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  To identify the specific SNP associated with both conditions, one would need to refer to scientific literature and databases on genetic associations with diseases. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
