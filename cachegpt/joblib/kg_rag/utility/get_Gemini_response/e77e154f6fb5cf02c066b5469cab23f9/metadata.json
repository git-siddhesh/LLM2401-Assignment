A transcription factor involved in cell growth, differentiation, and immune response.\\n* **BARD1:** BRCA1-associated protein 1.  A tumor suppressor gene that works with BRCA1 to repair DNA damage.\\n* **PTPN22:** Protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22.  An enzyme involved in immune system regulation.\\n* **PRKN:**  Parkin. A ubiquitin ligase involved in the degradation of damaged mitochondria.\\n* **C5AR1:** Complement component 5a receptor 1.  A receptor for the complement protein C5a, involved in inflammation and immune response.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  An autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints.\\n* **Myositis:**  A group of inflammatory diseases that affect muscles.\\n\\n**Associations:**\\n\\n* **STAT3:**  While not directly linked to RA, STAT3 signaling is involved in inflammatory processes and has been implicated in the development of some autoimmune diseases.\\n* **BARD1:**  No known direct association with RA or myositis. \\n* **PTPN22:**  A well-established genetic risk factor for RA. Variations in this gene are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease.\\n* **PRKN:**  No known direct association with RA or myositis. \\n* **C5AR1:**  The C5AR1 gene has been implicated in the development of inflammatory diseases, including RA and myositis.\\n\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**PTPN22 and C5AR1** are the genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis and myositis. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
