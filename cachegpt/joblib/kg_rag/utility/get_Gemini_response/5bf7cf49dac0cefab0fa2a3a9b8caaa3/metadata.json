Variant rs2574974 associates Disease herpes zoster\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n* **NANOS1:** A gene involved in embryonic development and germ cell formation. No known direct association with psoriatic arthritis or herpes zoster.\\n* **TLR1:** Toll-like receptor 1, a protein involved in innate immune responses to bacterial and fungal infections. Plays a role in inflammation, but not specifically linked to psoriatic arthritis or herpes zoster.\\n* **NTM:** Nontuberculous mycobacteria, a group of bacteria that can cause lung infections, but not directly associated with psoriatic arthritis or herpes zoster.\\n* **HLA-B:**  A gene within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involved in presenting antigens to the immune system. This gene is associated with both **psoriatic arthritis** and **herpes zoster**.  \\n* **SCN1A:** A gene encoding a sodium channel protein important for nerve function. Primarily associated with epilepsy and not directly linked to psoriatic arthritis or herpes zoster. \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene **HLA-B** is associated with both psoriatic arthritis and herpes zoster. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with psoriatic arthritis and herpes zoster.
