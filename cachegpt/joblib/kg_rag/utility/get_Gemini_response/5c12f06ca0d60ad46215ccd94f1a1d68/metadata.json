It's often associated with the immune system.\\n\\n**Crohn's Disease (CD):** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the digestive tract, characterized by inflammation and ulcers. It's also immune-mediated.\\n\\n**IL23R:** A gene encoding the interleukin-23 receptor. IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in both AS and CD pathogenesis.\\n\\n**HLA-DQB1:** A gene encoding a protein involved in antigen presentation to immune cells. HLA-DQB1 is associated with various autoimmune diseases, including AS and CD.\\n\\n**TNRC18:**  A gene involved in mRNA regulation. While not directly linked to AS or CD, it has been studied in relation to other inflammatory processes.\\n\\n**EYA2:** A gene involved in eye development. Not related to AS or CD.\\n\\n**SLC2A9:** A gene encoding a glucose transporter. Not directly linked to AS or CD.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease?** \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**IL23R and HLA-DQB1** are associated with both ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
