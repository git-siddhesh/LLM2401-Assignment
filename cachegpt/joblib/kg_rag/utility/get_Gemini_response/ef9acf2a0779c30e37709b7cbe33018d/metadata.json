Disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associates Gene TMEM42\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge for Entities:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **PRKAG2 (AMP-activated protein kinase gamma 2 subunit):** This gene encodes a subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Mutations in PRKAG2 are associated with various diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy and glycogen storage disease.\\n* **YLPM1 (Yippee-like protein 1):** This gene encodes a protein involved in vesicle trafficking and protein sorting. While its role in lung diseases is not fully understood, it has been linked to some types of cancer.\\n* **TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase):** This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes.  TERT over-expression is associated with cancer development, including lung cancer.\\n* **LOXL1 (lysyl oxidase like 1):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in collagen cross-linking, a process important for maintaining tissue structure and integrity. LOXL1 is implicated in various diseases, including fibrosis, and has been linked to lung fibrosis. \\n* **HLA-DQB1 (human leukocyte antigen, DQ beta 1):** This gene encodes a protein involved in the immune response. Variations in HLA-DQB1 are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including some types of lung disease. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Lung carcinoma:** A general term for cancers that originate in the lung.\\n* **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF):** A chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue. The cause of IPF is unknown.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**TERT and LOXL1** are associated with lung carcinoma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with lung carcinoma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
