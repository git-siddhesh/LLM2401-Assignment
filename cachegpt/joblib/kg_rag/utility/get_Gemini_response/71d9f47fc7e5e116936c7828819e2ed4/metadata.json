Disease ontology identifier of CAKUT1 is DOID:0080206\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)**: An autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin, characterized by rashes, lesions, and inflammation.\\n\\n**Collagenous Colitis (CC)**: A chronic inflammatory bowel disease causing inflammation of the colon, leading to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.\\n\\n**Variants (rs numbers):** Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are variations in the DNA sequence at a single nucleotide. These variations are identified by \"rs\" numbers, for example, rs4939827. Each rs number corresponds to a specific location in the genome. \\n\\n**Association:** In genetics, association refers to the statistical relationship between a genetic variant (like an SNP) and a trait or disease. \\n\\n## Question: \\nWhich SNP, from the given list, is associated with both cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and collagenous colitis (CC)? \\n\\n**Note:**  It\\'s important to remember that the information provided here is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  To identify the specific SNP associated with both conditions, one would need to refer to scientific literature and databases on genetic associations with diseases. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and collagenous colitis.
