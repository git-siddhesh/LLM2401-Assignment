Disease oral cavity cancer associates Gene GPN1.\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **CRTC1:**  CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1.  Plays a role in regulating gene expression and is involved in various cellular processes. \\n* **PLG:**  Plasminogen.  A key component of the fibrinolytic system, responsible for breaking down blood clots.\\n* **AHR:**  Aryl hydrocarbon receptor.  A transcription factor involved in mediating the effects of environmental pollutants and other toxins.\\n* **SLC14A2:** Solute carrier family 14, member 2.  A protein responsible for transporting chloride ions across cell membranes.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Human Leukocyte Antigen - DQB1.  A gene involved in the immune system's recognition of foreign antigens. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Nephrotic syndrome:**  A kidney disorder characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia.\\n* **Oral cavity cancer:**  Cancer that develops in the tissues of the mouth, including the lips, tongue, gums, and throat. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**None of the genes listed are directly associated with both nephrotic syndrome and oral cavity cancer.** \\n\\n* **CRTC1** is primarily involved in metabolism and development. \\n* **PLG** is involved in blood clotting. \\n* **AHR** is involved in environmental toxin responses. \\n* **SLC14A2** is related to chloride transport. \\n* **HLA-DQB1** is involved in immune responses. \\n\\nThese genes do not have known strong links to either nephrotic syndrome or oral cavity cancer. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with nephrotic syndrome and oral cavity cancer. Given list is:  CRTC1, PLG,  AHR,  SLC14A2, HLA-DQB1\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert biomedical researcher.
