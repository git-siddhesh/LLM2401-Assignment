Dysregulation of TERT can contribute to cancer development. \\n* **USHBP1:** Usher Syndrome Type 1B Protein, a gene associated with hearing and vision loss, not directly linked to lung diseases.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** A progressive lung disease characterized by scarring and stiffening of the lung tissue. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic factors likely play a role.\\n* **Lung Adenocarcinoma:** A type of lung cancer that originates in the glands of the lungs.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\n**Which gene from the list is associated with both Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and Lung Adenocarcinoma?** \\n\\n**Answer:**  **TERT** \\n\\n**Explanation:**  While research is ongoing, TERT has been linked to both IPF and lung adenocarcinoma.  It is known to play a role in cell proliferation and telomere maintenance, both of which are involved in cancer development. Studies have shown associations between TERT variants and increased risk of IPF. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
