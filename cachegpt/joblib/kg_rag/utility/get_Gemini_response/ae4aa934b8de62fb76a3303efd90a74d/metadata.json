It is often associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n**Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH):** A chronic liver disease where the body's immune system attacks the liver cells, leading to inflammation and damage.\\n\\n**SLC14A2:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. It is not known to be associated with IgA deficiency or AIH.\\n\\n**PRKAG2:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating glycogen metabolism. It is not known to be associated with IgA deficiency or AIH.\\n\\n**HLA-DQA1:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the presentation of antigens to immune cells. It is known to be associated with both IgA deficiency and AIH.\\n\\n**PLG:** A gene that encodes a protein involved in the activation of plasminogen, a key component of the fibrinolytic system. It is not known to be associated with IgA deficiency or AIH.\\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**HLA-DQA1** is associated with both Immunoglobulin Alpha Deficiency and Autoimmune Hepatitis. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination.
