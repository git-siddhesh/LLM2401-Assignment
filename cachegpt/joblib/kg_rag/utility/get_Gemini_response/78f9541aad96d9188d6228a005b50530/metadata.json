TERT is often overexpressed in cancer cells, contributing to their immortality.\\n* **ULK4 (Unc-51 Like Kinase 4):** A protein kinase involved in autophagy, a cellular process of self-digestion. \\n* **ADGRG6 (Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G6):**  A cell surface receptor involved in cell adhesion and signaling, and potentially in some cancers. \\n\\n## Answer: \\n\\n**TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)** is associated with both triple-receptor negative breast cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with triple-receptor negative breast cancer and myeloproliferative neoplasm.
