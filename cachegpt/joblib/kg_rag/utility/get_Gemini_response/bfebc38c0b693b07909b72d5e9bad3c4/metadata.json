It is not known to be associated with wheat allergy or dengue hemorrhagic fever. \\n* **DLEU7 (Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 7):** This gene is involved in the development and function of the immune system. While it is not directly linked to wheat allergy, it plays a role in immune responses which could be relevant in the context of allergies.  \\n* **DMRT1 (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor 1):** This gene is involved in sex determination and development. It is not known to be associated with wheat allergy or dengue hemorrhagic fever.\\n* **ADGRG6 (Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G6):** This gene is involved in cell signaling and adhesion. It is not known to be associated with wheat allergy or dengue hemorrhagic fever.\\n* **RBFOX1 (RNA Binding Fox-1):** This gene is involved in RNA splicing and regulation of gene expression. It is not known to be associated with wheat allergy or dengue hemorrhagic fever.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nNone of the genes in the list are specifically associated with wheat allergy or dengue hemorrhagic fever. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
