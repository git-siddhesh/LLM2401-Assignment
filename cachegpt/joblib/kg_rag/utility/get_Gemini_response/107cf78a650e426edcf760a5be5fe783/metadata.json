Mutations in this gene can lead to increased cancer risk.\\n* **CFH:** (Complement Factor H)  A gene involved in the regulation of the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps fight infections. Variations in this gene are strongly associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\\n* **C1orf127:** A gene with unknown function.\\n* **CASZ1:** A gene that encodes a zinc finger protein involved in cell proliferation and development. It has been linked to various cancers.\\n* **HAAO:** (Hydroxyacid oxidase) An enzyme involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Age-related macular degeneration (AMD):** A leading cause of vision loss in older adults, affecting the macula, the central part of the retina.\\n* **Kidney disease:** A broad term referring to conditions affecting the kidneys' ability to filter waste from the blood.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**CFH** is associated with age-related macular degeneration. While it's not directly linked to kidney disease, it can be a contributing factor to certain kidney conditions through its role in the complement system. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with age related macular degeneration and kidney disease.
