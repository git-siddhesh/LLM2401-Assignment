While implicated in skin inflammation, its direct association with psoriasis or herpes zoster is not well-established.\\n* **HLA-B (Human Leukocyte Antigen B):** Part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) responsible for immune recognition. Certain HLA-B alleles are linked to increased risk of psoriasis.\\n* **PLA2G6 (Phospholipase A2 Group VI):** An enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. Its role in skin conditions is limited, and its association with psoriasis or herpes zoster is not prominent.\\n* **SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1):** Primarily associated with neurological disorders like epilepsy, not directly linked to psoriasis or herpes zoster.\\n* **KITLG (Kit Ligand):**  A growth factor involved in cell development and migration.  While it plays a role in skin development, its direct association with psoriasis or herpes zoster is not well documented. \\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Psoriasis:** An autoimmune skin disease characterized by red, scaly patches. \\n* **Herpes Zoster (Shingles):** A painful skin rash caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**HLA-B** is the gene most strongly associated with psoriasis. While it doesn't have a direct link to herpes zoster, it plays a crucial role in immune responses that can influence the susceptibility to various skin conditions. \\n\"", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
