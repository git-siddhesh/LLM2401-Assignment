Disease age related macular degeneration associates Gene B3GLCT\\nAdditional Knowledge: ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **CFH (Complement Factor H):** This gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial part of the immune response. Variations in this gene are strongly linked to both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and several kidney diseases, including  membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II.\\n* **MUC5B (Mucin 5B):** This gene produces a protein that forms a protective layer in the respiratory system.  While associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it's not directly linked to kidney or AMD.\\n* **DAB2IP (DAB2 Interacting Protein):** This gene plays a role in cell growth and development. It's implicated in some cancers but not primarily associated with kidney or AMD.\\n* **BTN2A1 (Butyrophilin Subfamily 2A Member 1):** This gene's function is complex, and while involved in the immune system, it's not directly related to kidney disease or AMD.\\n* **ADH1B (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1B):** This gene encodes an enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism. It's linked to certain conditions related to alcohol consumption but not kidney disease or AMD.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Kidney Disease:** A broad term encompassing various conditions that affect the kidneys, including glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and others.\\n* **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** A leading cause of vision loss in people over 50, affecting the macula, a part of the retina responsible for central vision.\\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\n**CFH** is the gene associated with both kidney disease and age-related macular degeneration. \\n\\n NOTE: Above answer may be hallucination. Please provide correct answer from context only.\\nQuestion: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with kidney disease and age related macular degeneration.
