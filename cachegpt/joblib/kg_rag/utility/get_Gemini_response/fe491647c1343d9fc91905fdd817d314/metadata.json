Dermatomyositis:**  \\n* An autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the muscles (myositis) and skin (dermatitis). \\n* Can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and skin rashes.\\n* Associated with increased risk of pulmonary hypertension. \\n\\n**2. Pulmonary Hypertension:**\\n* High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. \\n* Can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain.\\n* Can be caused by various factors, including autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis.\\n\\n**3. Genes:** \\n*  Units of heredity that are responsible for specific traits.\\n* Composed of DNA and located on chromosomes. \\n* Mutations in genes can lead to various diseases.\\n\\n**4. Gene List:**\\n* **TG:** Gene encoding apolipoprotein C-III, involved in lipid metabolism. \\n* **HLA-DPA1:** Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), involved in immune system function. \\n* **PNPLA3:**  Gene involved in triglyceride metabolism.  Associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\\n* **ZFPM2:** Gene encoding a transcription factor, involved in developmental processes. \\n* **UMOD:**  Gene encoding uromodulin, involved in kidney function and electrolyte balance.\\n\\n\\n## Question: \\nOut of the given list, which Gene is associated with dermatomyositis and pulmonary hypertension.
