Do not report any other entities like Genes, Proteins, Enzymes etc.\\n\\nSentence : ## Domain Knowledge:\\n\\n**Genes:**\\n\\n* **TGM2:**  Transglutaminase 2, an enzyme involved in cross-linking proteins. It has been implicated in skin diseases, including  **urticaria**.\\n* **TENM2:** Tenascin-M, a protein involved in cell adhesion and migration.  Its role in cancer, including **breast cancer**, is being investigated.\\n* **HLA-B:** Human Leukocyte Antigen B, a gene involved in the immune system.  Variations in HLA-B have been associated with **various diseases**, including **cancer and autoimmune disorders**.\\n* **RAD51B:**  A gene involved in DNA repair. Mutations in this gene can increase the risk of developing **various cancers**, including **breast cancer**.\\n* **GSDMB:**  Gasdermin B, a protein involved in inflammation and cell death. It has been implicated in **allergic reactions**, including **urticaria**, and is being investigated for its role in **cancer**.\\n\\n**Diseases:**\\n\\n* **Urticaria:**  Also known as hives, is a skin condition characterized by raised, itchy welts.\\n* **Male breast cancer:** A rare form of cancer that affects men.\\n\\n## Question:\\n\\nWhich gene is associated with both urticaria and male breast cancer?\\n\\n**Answer:**  **TGM2** has been linked to urticaria, and while not directly linked to male breast cancer, it is known to play a role in cell growth and proliferation, processes relevant to cancer development.  However, it is important to note that more research is needed to determine its direct role in male breast cancer. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
