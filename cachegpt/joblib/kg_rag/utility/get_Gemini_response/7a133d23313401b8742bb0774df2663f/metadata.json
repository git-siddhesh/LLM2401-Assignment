Primarily involved in cardiac function and smooth muscle contraction.\\n* **TFAP2B:** Encodes a transcription factor involved in development, particularly of the head and face. Mutations can cause cleft palate and other craniofacial abnormalities.\\n* **STAT4:**  A transcription factor involved in the signaling pathway of interferons (immune messengers). It plays a role in immune responses and development of autoimmune diseases.\\n* **HLA-DQB1:** Part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involved in presenting antigens to immune cells. Variations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases.\\n* **PTK2B:**  Encodes a protein tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, differentiation, and migration.  \\n\\n## Answer:\\n\\nThe gene associated with rheumatic heart disease and nephrotic syndrome is **HLA-DQB1**. \\n'", "system_prompt": "'You are an expert disease entity extractor from a sentence and report it as JSON in the following format:\\nDiseases: <List of extracted entities>\\nPlease report only Diseases.
